## Glossary of Terms

**Advanced Energy Solutions (AES):** Quantum Energy's non-regulated business unit focused on developing and delivering innovative energy-related products and services, such as smart home solutions, EV charging infrastructure, and distributed generation.

**Architectural View:** A representation of a complete system from the perspective of a related set of concerns. Used to communicate specific aspects of the architecture to particular stakeholders.

**Asset Management:** The capability to plan, optimize, and manage the lifecycle of physical assets (e.g., generation plants, transmission lines, pipelines, substations) from acquisition through decommissioning to achieve reliability, performance, and cost objectives.

**BIZBOK (Business Architecture Body of Knowledge):** A comprehensive guide providing a common framework, terminology, and best practices for the discipline of business architecture. Quantum Energy aligns its BA practice with BIZBOK.

**Business Architecture (BA):** A discipline that represents holistic, multi-dimensional business views of capabilities, end-to-end value delivery, information, and organizational structure, and the relationships among them and to the enterprise strategy.

**Business Capability:** Defines "what" a business does (e.g., "Manage Customer Accounts," "Deliver Electric Energy"), independent of "how" it does it, "who" does it, or "where" it does it. Capabilities are stable over time and are the primary targets for investment.

**Capability-Based Planning:** An approach that uses business capabilities as the primary lens for strategic planning, investment prioritization, and transformation initiatives.

**Chief Digital & Innovation Officer (CDIO):** Quantum Energy's executive responsible for driving digital transformation and leading the development and growth of non-regulated advanced offerings.

**Customer Experience (CX):** The sum of all interactions a customer has with Quantum Energy, from initial inquiry to ongoing service, across both regulated and non-regulated offerings.

**Demand-Side Management (DSM):** Programs and services designed to influence the quantity or timing of customer energy consumption (e.g., energy efficiency, demand response).

**Distributed Energy Resources (DER):** Smaller, decentralized energy sources (e.g., solar PV, battery storage, electric vehicles) located at or near the point of consumption, often integrated with the grid.

**Enterprise Architecture (EA):** The practice of analyzing and documenting an enterprise in terms of its business, information, application, and technology environments to execute strategic goals. BA is a key domain within EA.

**Electric Distribution:** The capability to deliver electrical energy from the transmission system to end-use customers through medium and low-voltage infrastructure (e.g., poles, wires, substations).

**Electric Transmission:** The capability to transport bulk electrical power from generation sources to distribution systems and major customers through high-voltage transmission infrastructure.

**Energy Trading and Risk Management (ETRM):** The capability to participate in wholesale energy markets, optimize asset portfolios, and manage commodity price and operational risks.

**EV Charging Infrastructure:** Facilities and services for charging electric vehicles, often including publicly accessible stations and home charging solutions.

**Gas Distribution:** The capability to deliver natural gas from transmission pipelines to end-use customers through low-pressure distribution infrastructure (e.g., mains, service lines, meters).

**Gas Transmission and Storage:** The capability to transport natural gas through high-pressure pipeline systems and manage underground storage facilities.

**Governance:** The framework of authorities and processes by which the Business Architecture practice is directed, monitored, and held accountable.

**Initiative:** A program, project, or effort designed to achieve specific strategic objectives, typically by enhancing one or more business capabilities.

**Key Performance Indicator (KPI):** A quantifiable measure used to evaluate the success of an organization, employee, or initiative in meeting objectives.

**Metamodel:** The underlying structure that describes how an architecture is organized, defining the types of architectural elements and their relationships.

**Metering and Measurement:** The capability to measure, record, and validate energy consumption and system flows to support billing, settlement, operations, and customer programs.

**Natural Gas Supply:** The capability to source, purchase, transport, and manage natural gas supplies from producers and markets.

**Non-Regulated Offerings:** Products and services offered by Quantum Energy that are not subject to traditional utility regulation (e.g., smart home services, EV charging solutions, energy consulting). These are often provided by separate, non-utility business units.

**Product (or Service):** A tangible or intangible offering delivered to customers and stakeholders to fulfill a value proposition. Quantum Energy offers both regulated utility products and non-regulated advanced offerings.

**Quantum Energy:** The fictional vertically integrated pure play natural gas and electric utility with utility supporting and utility like non-regulated offerings, for which this knowledgebase is being developed.

**Regulated Operations:** The core utility business of Quantum Energy that is subject to oversight and control by government agencies (e.g., Public Utility Commissions, FERC).

**Stakeholder:** Any individual, group, or organization with an interest in, or influence on, Quantum Energy's business (e.g., customers, regulators, employees, shareholders, partners).

**Smart Home Solutions:** Non-regulated products and services enabling customers to manage and optimize energy use, comfort, and security within their homes using connected devices and platforms.

**Strategic Objective:** A specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goal that supports a strategic theme.

**Strategy to Reality:** A framework or methodology that helps translate an organization's high-level strategy into actionable plans and execution through the use of business architecture.

**System Operations and Control:** The capability to monitor, control, and balance the electric and gas systems in real-time to maintain reliability, safety, and operational integrity.

**Value Proposition:** The promise of value to be delivered to a stakeholder; the primary reason a customer would choose to buy a product or service.

**Value Stream:** An end-to-end collection of value-adding activities that creates an overall result for a customer, stakeholder, or end user. It describes "how" value is created and delivered.
