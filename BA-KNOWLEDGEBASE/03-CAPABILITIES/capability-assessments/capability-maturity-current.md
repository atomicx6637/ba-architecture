## 1. Capability Maturity Model (Simplified)

Quantum Energy employs a simplified 5-level maturity model for its business capabilities, adapted from common industry frameworks (e.g., CMMI).

*   **Level 1: Initial/Ad Hoc**
    *   Processes are unpredictable, poorly controlled, and reactive. Success depends on individual heroics.
    *   Limited documentation, inconsistent practices.
    *   No formal metrics or performance tracking.

*   **Level 2: Managed/Planned**
    *   Processes are planned and executed; work is tracked.
    *   Basic documentation, some repeatable practices.
    *   Project/capability performance is monitored, often at a basic level.
    *   Often siloed by team or department.

*   **Level 3: Defined/Standardized**
    *   Processes are well-characterized, understood, and described in standards, procedures, and methods.
    *   Proactive approach, with defined roles and responsibilities.
    *   Standardized measurements are collected and analyzed.
    *   Some cross-functional coordination.

*   **Level 4: Quantitatively Managed/Measured**
    *   Processes are measured and controlled. Quantitative objectives for quality and process performance are established and used.
    *   Predictable performance with statistically managed outcomes.
    *   Advanced analytics and continuous monitoring are integrated.

*   **Level 5: Optimizing**
    *   Continuous process improvement is enabled by quantitative feedback and innovative approaches.
    *   Focus on agility, innovation, and proactive adaptation to change.
    *   Benchmarking and external best practices are regularly integrated.

## 2. Current State Maturity Assessment - Key Capabilities

Below is the current maturity assessment for a selection of Quantum Energy's core capabilities, as of Q4 2025. This assessment reflects our current operational state, technological adoption, and process effectiveness.

| Capability ID | L1 Capability Name | L2 Capability Name | Scope | Current Maturity Level | Rationale/Key Observations |
| :------------ | :----------------- | :----------------- | :---- | :--------------------- | :------------------------- |
| **8.5** | Electric Distribution | Distribution Automation & Grid Modernization | Reg | **Level 2** | Pilot projects in DA, but not fully integrated or scaled across the entire service territory. Limited advanced analytics. |
| **9.5** | Gas Distribution | Leak Detection & Pipeline Safety | Reg | **Level 3** | Well-defined processes and robust regulatory compliance programs. Regular surveys and inspection cycles. Continuous improvement efforts are ongoing. |
| **10.5** | Customer Engagement & Service | Digital Customer Experience | Ent | **Level 2** | Basic web portal and mobile app features. Lack of unified experience between regulated and non-regulated channels. Limited personalization. |
| **10.8** | Customer Engagement & Service | Customer Insights & Analytics | Ent | **Level 2** | Disparate data sources, nascent analytics capabilities. Relying on basic reporting rather than predictive modeling. |
| **11.3** | Non-Regulated Product Development | Product Development & Engineering | NonReg | **Level 2** | Ad-hoc development for new offerings. Lack of standardized agile practices. Heavy reliance on external vendors. |
| **12.4** | Non-Regulated Sales & Marketing | Customer Acquisition & Conversion | NonReg | **Level 2** | Sales processes are evolving, with limited automation. Inconsistent lead qualification and pipeline management. |
| **13.3** | System Operations & Grid Control | Electric System Balancing & Dispatch | Ent | **Level 4** | Highly mature, tightly controlled processes for real-time grid operations. Strong regulatory oversight and NERC compliance. |
| **14.2** | Financial Management | General Accounting & Reporting | Ent | **Level 3** | Standardized processes, but complex separation of regulated/non-regulated financials still requires significant manual effort. |
| **16.4** | Information Technology & Digital Services | Cybersecurity & Information Security | Ent | **Level 3** | Robust security measures in place for regulated systems. Expanding efforts to secure non-regulated platforms and customer data. |

## 3. General Observations Across Capabilities

*   **Regulated vs. Non-Regulated:** Capabilities directly related to core regulated operations (e.g., Electric System Balancing) often exhibit higher maturity due to long-standing processes, regulatory mandates, and investment. Non-regulated capabilities, being newer, are typically at lower maturity levels, reflecting an earlier stage of development.
*   **Digitalization Gaps:** Significant opportunities exist to leverage digitalization to elevate maturity, particularly in customer-facing and internal operational support capabilities (e.g., Digital Customer Experience, Customer Insights & Analytics).
*   **Integration Challenges:** Many capabilities suffer from a lack of seamless integration across regulated and non-regulated data, systems, and processes, leading to inefficiencies and fragmented customer experiences.
