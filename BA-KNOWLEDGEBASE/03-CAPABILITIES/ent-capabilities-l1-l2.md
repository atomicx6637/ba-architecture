# Enterprise Capabilities - Level 1 and Level 2
## Quantum Energy

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-11-25
**Standard:** BIZBOK Guide to Business Architecture
**Scope:** Enterprise-wide L1 and L2 Capability Model for Quantum Energy

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines the Level One (L1) and Level Two (L2) business capabilities for Quantum Energy, a vertically integrated natural gas and electric utility with a strategic portfolio of utility-supporting and utility-like non-regulated offerings. These capabilities represent **what** the business does, independent of **how** it is done or **who** performs it.

The capability model follows BIZBOK principles:
-   Capabilities are business-oriented, not organization-specific.
-   Each capability is unique and mutually exclusive at each level.
-   Capabilities are stable over time and independent of strategic initiatives.
-   The model covers the complete value chain from commodity sourcing through customer delivery, including new value creation in non-regulated markets.
-   L2 capabilities decompose each L1 into 4-8 sub-capabilities that are collectively exhaustive.

This version includes complete L2 decomposition for all L1 capabilities, organized into three strategic groupings (Strategic, Core, Supporting), with explicit distinction where capabilities primarily serve Regulated (Reg), Non-Regulated (NonReg), or Enterprise (Ent) functions.

## Next Steps: Level 3 Decomposition

Priority areas for Level 3 decomposition based on complexity, strategic importance, and current transformation initiatives:

1.  **Regulated Operations L3 Capabilities** (e.g., specific Electric Distribution, Gas Distribution processes, e.g. "Overhead Line Maintenance," "Pressure Zone Management").
2.  **Customer Experience L3 Capabilities** (e.g., detailed customer journey stages for "Onboarding New Customer," "Outage Communication").
3.  **Non-Regulated Solutions L3 Capabilities** (e.g., "Smart Home Device Integration," "EV Charger Network Planning," "Energy Consulting Delivery").
4.  **Integrated Grid Management L3 Capabilities** (e.g., "DER Interconnection Process," "Grid Edge Device Management").

## Alignment to BIZBOK Metamodel

This L1/L2 capability model provides the foundation for:

-   **Value Stream Mapping:** L2 capabilities enable specific value stream stages across all business segments.
-   **Organization Mapping:** L2 capabilities map to specific roles and organizational units, including new non-regulated business units.
-   **Information Mapping:** L2 capabilities define information requirements and data entities, emphasizing data separation/sharing.
-   **Strategy Mapping:** L2 capabilities receive strategic direction and investment, balancing regulated needs with non-regulated growth.
-   **Initiative Mapping:** Initiatives target specific L2 capability improvements, often with cross-segment impact.
-   **Metrics Mapping:** KPIs measure L2 capability performance and maturity, with distinct metrics for regulated efficiency and non-regulated profitability.
