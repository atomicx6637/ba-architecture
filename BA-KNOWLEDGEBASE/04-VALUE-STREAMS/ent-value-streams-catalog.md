## Executive Summary

This document defines the business value streams for Quantum Energy, a vertically integrated natural gas and electric utility with a strategic portfolio of non-regulated offerings. Value streams represent end-to-end flows of value delivery to stakeholders, describing **how** value is created and delivered through a series of stages that transform inputs into valued outputs.

The value stream model follows BIZBOK principles:
-   Value streams represent stakeholder-to-stakeholder flows of value.
-   Each value stream has a clear triggering stakeholder and value proposition.
-   Value stream stages are enabled by business capabilities.
-   Value streams are stable patterns independent of organizational structure.
-   Value streams cross functional and organizational boundaries, often bridging regulated and non-regulated segments.

This model includes 29 value streams organized into six strategic categories, covering both core regulated utility operations and non-regulated advanced energy solutions.
