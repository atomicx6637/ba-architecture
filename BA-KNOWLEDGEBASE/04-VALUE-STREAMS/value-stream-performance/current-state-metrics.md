## Executive Summary

This document presents the current state performance metrics for a selection of Quantum Energy's key value streams. These metrics provide a baseline understanding of how effectively we are currently delivering value to our stakeholders across both regulated utility operations and non-regulated advanced energy solutions. This assessment identifies current strengths and areas requiring improvement to meet our strategic objectives.

## 2. Current State Performance Metrics - Key Value Streams

| Value Stream ID | Value Stream Name | Scope | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) | Current Baseline (Q4 2025) | Unit | Observations/Context |
| :-------------- | :---------------- | :---- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------- | :--- | :------------------- |
| **RCV-01** | **Regulated Customer Acquisition** | Reg | Average Time to Connect New Service | 5.5 | Business Days | Inconsistent across electric/gas, manual steps still prevalent. |
| | | | First Bill Accuracy Rate | 97.2% | % | Some errors related to meter read transfer and prorated charges. |
| **RCV-02** | **Regulated Customer Service Delivery** | Reg | First Contact Resolution (FCR) Rate - Call Center | 72% | % | High volume of calls requiring transfers for complex issues. |
| | | | Average Call Handle Time (AHT) | 380 | Seconds | Elevated due to system navigation and knowledge gaps. |
| **NCV-01** | **Smart Home Solution Delivery** | NonReg | Average Installation Cycle Time | 14 | Business Days | Long lead times for scheduling and inventory management. |
| | | | Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) - Post Install | 3.8 / 5 | Score | Room for improvement in post-install education and support. |
| **NCV-02** | **EV Charging Solution Deployment** | NonReg | New Charger Activation Rate | 85% | % of installs | Issues with customer network setup and charger connectivity. |
| | | | Average Time to Resolve Technical Issues | 48 | Hours | Reliance on manual troubleshooting and external vendor support. |
| **AOV-04** | **Electric Energy Delivery** | Reg | SAIDI (System Avg Interruption Duration Index) | 180 | Minutes | Impacted by aging infrastructure and severe weather events. |
| | | | SAIFI (System Avg Interruption Frequency Index) | 1.8 | Count | Consistent with industry average, but target is higher. |
| **AOV-05** | **Natural Gas Delivery** | Reg | Preventable Gas Incident Rate | 0.05 | Per 100 miles of main | Occasional third-party damage, aging pipe. |
| | | | Average Time to Restore Service (Gas Outage) | 6.2 | Hours | Crew availability and equipment limitations. |
| **REV-01** | **Rate Case & Cost Recovery** | Reg | Average Rate Case Cycle Time | 18 | Months | Extended due to discovery, negotiations, and manual data gathering. |
| | | | Final Approved ROE vs. Requested ROE | 8.9% vs 9.5% | % | Negotiated settlements often result in lower than requested returns. |
| **ESV-01** | **Enterprise Strategic Planning & Execution** | Ent | Strategic Initiative Completion Rate (On-Time/On-Budget) | 65% | % | Challenges in resource allocation and cross-functional coordination. |
| | | | Percentage of Employees Aware of Top 3 Strategic Priorities | 55% | % | Lack of consistent internal communication on strategy. |

## 3. General Observations Across Value Streams

*   **Regulated Service Efficiency:** While core regulated services are generally reliable, there are opportunities to reduce cycle times and improve first-contact resolution through digital and process enhancements.
*   **Non-Regulated Scalability Challenges:** Non-regulated value streams show longer cycle times and lower activation rates, indicating a need to streamline processes, improve training, and enhance technology platforms to support growth.
*   **Data & Integration:** Many value streams are hampered by disparate data sources and lack of integration, making it difficult to gain real-time insights and automate handoffs.
*   **Customer Experience Gaps:** The customer journey often feels fragmented, especially when transitioning between regulated and non-regulated offerings.
