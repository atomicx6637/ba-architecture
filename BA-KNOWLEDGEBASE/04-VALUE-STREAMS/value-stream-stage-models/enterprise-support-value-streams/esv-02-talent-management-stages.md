## 3. Cross-Value Stream Dependencies

*   **ESV-02** is a critical enabler for all other value streams, as they cannot execute without skilled people.
*   It is tightly coupled with **ESV-01 Enterprise Strategic Planning & Execution**, which provides the demand signal for future talent needs.
*   It works with **ESV-03 Financial Management & Reporting** to manage the company's largest expense: payroll and benefits.
*   The hiring of specialized talent (e.g., traders, data scientists) is a key dependency for advanced value streams like **SMV-01** and **SMV-03**.
