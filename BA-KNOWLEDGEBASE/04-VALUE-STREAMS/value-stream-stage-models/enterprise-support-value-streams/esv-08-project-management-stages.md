# ESV-08: Project & Program Delivery Value Stream

This document outlines the stages of the Project & Program Delivery value stream, which begins after a demand has been approved and converted into a formal project. This process governs the end-to-end execution of the project, from initiation to final closure and hand-off. The Enterprise Project Management Office (EPMO) is the primary manager of this value stream.

## Value Stream Stages

| Stage | Description | Entry Criteria | Key Activities | Deliverables | Exit Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Initiating** | The project is formally authorized and defined, and the project manager is assigned. The purpose and high-level objectives are confirmed. | An approved and funded demand is handed over from the Demand Management process. | - EPMO assigns a Project Manager.<br>- Develop and approve the Project Charter, formally authorizing the project.<br>- Identify key stakeholders and project team members.<br>- Confirm alignment with the original business case and architectural intent from the demand process. | - Signed Project Charter<br>- Stakeholder Register | The Project Charter is signed off, and the project is officially initiated. |
| **2. Planning** | Detailed planning is conducted to define the project scope, schedule, budget, and how the project will be executed, monitored, and controlled. | A signed Project Charter exists and a Project Manager is assigned. | - Develop the detailed Project Management Plan (PMP).<br>- Define and baseline scope, schedule, and cost.<br>- EA provides the detailed solution architecture and design.<br>- Develop plans for risk management, quality, and stakeholder communication.<br>- Secure final resource assignments. | - Approved PMP<br>- Baselines (Scope, Schedule, Cost)<br>- Solution Architecture | The Project Management Plan and all subsidiary plans are approved and baselined. |
| **3. Executing** | The work defined in the project management plan is performed to produce the project's deliverables. | An approved and baselined Project Management Plan is in place. | - Direct and manage project work.<br>- Procure necessary resources.<br>- Implement the planned quality, risk, and communication activities.<br>- Conduct architectural compliance reviews at key checkpoints.<br>- Monitor progress and manage variances from the baseline. | - Project Deliverables (e.g., code, systems)<br>- Status Reports<br>- Change Requests | All project deliverables are built, tested, and ready for deployment. |
| **4. Delivering** | The project's final deliverables are deployed to the business, and the solution is transitioned to the operational support teams. | All deliverables from the 'Executing' stage have passed quality checks and are ready for UAT and deployment. | - Manage and execute the deployment or go-live plan.<br>- Conduct User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and secure sign-off.<br>- Execute the organizational change management (OCM) and training plans.<br>- Formally transition the solution to the business and IT operations teams. | - Deployed Solution<br>- UAT Sign-off<br>- Training Materials<br>- Go-Live Communications | The solution is live in the production environment, and business & operational support is in place. |
| **5. Closing** | The project is formally closed, documenting final performance, lessons learned, and ensuring all loose ends are tied up. | The solution has been successfully delivered and operationalized in the 'Delivering' stage. | - Obtain final acceptance of the solution from the sponsor.<br>- Conduct a post-implementation review and document lessons learned.<br>- Finalize and archive all project records.<br>- Close out contracts and release the project team.<br>- Formally transition ownership for benefits realization tracking. | - Final Project Report<br>- Lessons Learned<br>- Archived Project Artifacts | The project is formally closed, and the final project report is approved and archived. |
