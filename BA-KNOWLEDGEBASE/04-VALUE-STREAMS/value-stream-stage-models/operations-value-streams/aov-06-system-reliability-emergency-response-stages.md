## Executive Summary

This document details the stages of the System Reliability & Emergency Response value stream (AOV-06). This critical value stream describes how Quantum Energy both proactively works to prevent system failures and reactively responds to large-scale events that threaten public safety and service continuity. It encompasses everything from routine reliability engineering to all-hands-on-deck storm and emergency restoration efforts.

## 1. Value Stream Context

**Value Stream ID:** AOV-06
**Name:** System Reliability & Emergency Response
**Description:** Maintain grid and pipeline system reliability through proactive management and rapidly respond to emergencies (outages, gas leaks, cyber-attacks) to restore service and safety.

**Entry Criteria:**
-   An emergency event (e.g., major storm, gas leak, cyber-attack) occurs or is imminent.
-   The company's Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is activated.
-   Proactive reliability analysis identifies a major systemic risk.

**Exit Criteria:**
-   Immediate threats to public safety are fully mitigated.
-   Critical infrastructure and services are restored.
-   All affected customers are restored, or long-term restoration plans are in place.
-   The system is returned to a stable, normal operating state.
-   A post-event review is completed to identify improvements.

## 2. Value Stream Stages and Enabling Capabilities

| Stage ID | Stage Name | Description | Enabling Capabilities (L2 Examples) | Expected Inputs | Expected Outputs | Key Metrics |
| :------- | :--------- | :---------- | :---------------------------------- | :-------------- | :--------------- | :---------- |
| **AOV-06.1** | **Proactive Reliability & Risk Analysis** | Analyze historical system performance and asset data to identify and prioritize risks. Develop and fund programs to proactively improve system reliability and resilience. | *   12.1 Asset Investment Planning | Performance data (SAIDI/SAIFI), Asset health data | Reliability improvement plans, Hardening projects | SAIDI/SAIFI/CAIDI trends, Customers Experiencing Multiple Interruptions (CEMI) |
| **AOV-06.2** | **Event Prediction & Preparedness** | Monitor external conditions (e.g., weather forecasts, threat intelligence) to predict potential events. Prepare resources, pre-stage materials, and secure mutual assistance. | *   15.5 Emergency Management & Business Continuity | Weather models, Threat briefs | Preparedness plans, Mobilized resources | Forecast accuracy, Resource readiness |
| **AOV-06.3** | **Event Detection & EOC Activation** | Detect the onset of a major event. Assess the initial impact and activate the formal Emergency Operations Center (EOC) structure to manage the response. | *   13.6 Outage & Disturbance Management | System alarms, Customer calls, 911 calls | Activated EOC, Incident Command Structure (ICS) roles filled | EOC activation time, Situational awareness established |
| **AOV-06.4** | **Damage Assessment & Restoration Prioritization** | Dispatch scouts and crews to assess the extent of the damage. Use this information to prioritize restoration work based on public safety, critical customers, and outage size. | *   10.2 Field Service & Work Management | Damage reports, Crew scouting info | Global damage assessment, Prioritized restoration plan | Damage assessment accuracy, Time to develop plan |
| **AOV-06.5** | **Large-Scale Resource Mobilization & Logistics** | Mobilize internal crews and external resources (contractors, mutual assistance). Manage the logistics of housing, feeding, and supplying a large, temporary workforce. | *   15.6 Logistics & Warehousing | Restoration plan, Resource requests | Staged crews, Material supply chain | Mutual assistance arrival time, Logistics efficiency |
| **AOV-06.6** | **Multi-Day Restoration & Stakeholder Communication** | Execute a sustained, multi-day restoration effort, coordinating thousands of individual work orders. Provide regular, transparent updates to the public, media, and regulators. | *   AOV-03 (Value Stream) | Prioritized restoration plan | Restored customers, Public communications (ETRs) | Customers restored per day, ETR accuracy |
| | | | *   1.5 Public Relations & Media Management | | | |
| **AOV-06.7** | **Demobilization & Post-Event Review** | As restoration completes, safely demobilize external resources. Conduct a formal after-action review to identify lessons learned and create improvement plans. | *   15.5 Emergency Management & Business Continuity | Completed restoration | Demobilized resources, After-action report | Demobilization cost, Improvement actions identified |

## 3. Cross-Value Stream Dependencies

*   **AOV-06** is the large-scale, emergency-focused version of **AOV-03 Work & Outage Management**.
*   Proactive work identified in this value stream is planned and funded via **AOV-01 Asset Lifecycle Management**.
*   It has a massive interface with **REV-03 External Stakeholder Engagement** and **RCV-02 Regulated Customer Service Delivery** during events.
*   The performance during major events is a key topic in **REV-01 Rate Case & Cost Recovery** and **REV-02 Regulatory Compliance & Reporting**.
