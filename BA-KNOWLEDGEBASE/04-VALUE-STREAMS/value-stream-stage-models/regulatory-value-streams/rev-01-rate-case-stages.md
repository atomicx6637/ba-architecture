## 1. Value Stream Context

**Value Stream ID:** REV-01
**Name:** Rate Case & Cost Recovery
**Description:** The formal regulatory process undertaken by Quantum Energy to request and justify changes to its regulated rates for electric and/or natural gas services.

**Entry Criteria:**
-   Earned return is consistently below authorized levels, or costs significantly exceed current revenue recovery.
-   Significant capital investments require rate base treatment.
-   Regulatory filing cycle dictates a rate case.
-   Strategic decision to initiate a rate case is made and approved by Quantum Energy leadership.

**Exit Criteria:**
-   Regulatory commission issues a final order approving new rates.
-   New rates are implemented in the billing system.
-   Revenue requirement is adequately recovered.
-   All regulatory compliance obligations related to the rate case are met.

*   It is supported by **ESV-03 Financial Management & Reporting** for accurate financial data.
*   Its outcomes directly impact **RCV-03 Regulated Billing & Payment** and all regulated customer-facing value streams.
*   Information from **REV-03 External Stakeholder Engagement** is critical for managing public perception during a rate case.
