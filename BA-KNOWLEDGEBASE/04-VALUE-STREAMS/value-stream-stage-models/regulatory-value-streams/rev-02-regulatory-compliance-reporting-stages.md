## Executive Summary

This document details the stages of the Regulatory Compliance & Reporting value stream (REV-02). This crucial, enterprise-wide process describes how Quantum Energy identifies, interprets, adheres to, and reports on the vast web of regulations that govern its operations.

## 3. Cross-Value Stream Dependencies

*   **REV-02** is all-encompassing. It governs the "rules of the road" for nearly every other value stream, especially the regulated streams like **RCV-01 through 05** and **AOV-01 through 06**.
*   It often works closely with **REV-01 Rate Case & Cost Recovery**, as compliance costs must be justified and recovered.
*   Failures in this value stream can trigger penalties that impact **ESV-03 Financial Management & Reporting**.
*   It is a key consumer of data managed by **ESV-04 Information Technology & Digital Service Delivery**.
