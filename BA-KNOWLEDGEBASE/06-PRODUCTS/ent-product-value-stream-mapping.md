## Executive Summary

This document provides a crucial mapping between Quantum Energy's products and services and the value streams that execute their delivery. This mapping illustrates how "what" we sell (products) is delivered through "how" we create value (value streams) for our customers. It highlights the end-to-end delivery processes for both regulated and non-regulated offerings, and is fundamental for understanding operational efficiency, identifying improvement opportunities, and optimizing the customer experience.

## 1. Introduction to Mapping Methodology

This mapping links Quantum Energy's Products and Services (from `ent-product-catalog.md`) to the Value Streams (from `ent-value-streams-catalog.md`) that primarily drive their delivery. A product may be the primary outcome of one value stream but also involve supporting elements from others.
