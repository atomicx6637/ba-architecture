## 1. Introduction

Smart Device Data encompasses the telemetry, status, and command information generated by customer-sited devices such as smart thermostats, smart plugs, EV chargers, solar inverters, and battery storage systems that are part of Quantum Energy's non-regulated offerings. This granular data enables the intelligent control and optimization of these devices and informs product development.

## 2. Key Information Entities

### 2.1. Connected Device

*   **Definition:** A unique identifier and record for a physical smart device installed at a customer's premise, managed as part of a non-regulated solution.
*   **Attributes:**
    *   `Device_ID` (Primary Key)
    *   `Subscription_ID` (Foreign Key - links to Non-Regulated Product Subscription)
    *   `Device_Type` (e.g., "Smart Thermostat", "Smart Plug", "EV Charger", "Solar Inverter", "Battery Storage Unit")
    *   `Manufacturer`
    *   `Model`
    *   `Serial_Number`
    *   `Installation_Date`
    *   `Firmware_Version`
    *   `Current_Status` (e.g., "Online", "Offline", "Error", "Charging", "Discharging")
    *   `Last_Heartbeat_Timestamp`
    *   `Location_Details` (e.g., "Living Room", "Garage", "External")
    *   `MAC_Address` / `IP_Address`
*   **Relationships:**
    *   Many-to-one with Non-Regulated Product Subscription.
    *   One-to-many with Device Telemetry.
    *   One-to-many with Device Control Log.

### 2.2. Device Telemetry

*   **Definition:** Time-series data representing measurements, readings, or status updates reported by a Connected Device at regular intervals.
*   **Attributes:**
    *   `Telemetry_ID` (Primary Key - often composite with Device_ID and Timestamp)
    *   `Device_ID` (Foreign Key)
    *   `Timestamp` (Date and Time of reading)
    *   `Metric_Name` (e.g., "Temperature", "Power_Consumption", "State_of_Charge", "Solar_Generation_kW")
    *   `Metric_Value`
    *   `Unit_of_Measure` (e.g., "Celsius", "kWh", "%", "kW")
    *   `Data_Source` (e.g., "Device Sensor", "Calculated")
*   **Relationships:**
    *   Many-to-one with Connected Device.
    *   Can be aggregated for Customer Insights & Analytics or operational monitoring.

### 2.3. Device Control Log

*   **Definition:** Records of commands sent to a Connected Device, whether initiated by a customer, an automated rule, or a Quantum Energy system.
*   **Attributes:**
    *   `Control_Log_ID` (Primary Key)
    *   `Device_ID` (Foreign Key)
    *   `Timestamp`
    *   `Command_Type` (e.g., "Set_Temperature", "Turn_On", "Start_Charge", "Demand_Response_Event")
    *   `Command_Parameter` (e.g., "72F", "Bedroom Light", "Max 80% SOC")
    *   `Initiator` (e.g., "Customer App", "Automated Schedule", "Grid Operator")
    *   `Execution_Status` (e.g., "Success", "Failed", "Pending")
*   **Relationships:**
    *   Many-to-one with Connected Device.
    *   Used for auditing, troubleshooting, and verifying grid service participation.

### 2.4. Smart Home Automation Rule

*   **Definition:** A customer-defined or system-defined automated rule that triggers actions on one or more Connected Devices based on specific conditions.
*   **Attributes:**
    *   `Rule_ID` (Primary Key)
    *   `Subscription_ID` (Foreign Key)
    *   `Rule_Name`
    *   `Description`
    *   `Conditions` (e.g., "If Temperature > 75F", "If Motion Detected", "If Time is 5 PM")
    *   `Actions` (e.g., "Set Thermostat to 72F", "Turn on Living Room Lights")
    *   `Status` (e.g., "Active", "Inactive")
    *   `Last_Modified_Date`
*   **Relationships:**
    *   Many-to-one with Non-Regulated Product Subscription.
    *   Triggers entries in Device Control Log.

## 3. Data Governance Considerations

*   **Privacy & Consent:** Paramount importance of obtaining and managing explicit customer consent for collection, use, and sharing of all Smart Device Data. Adherence to all relevant privacy regulations (e.g., CCPA, GDPR, state-specific utility data privacy laws).
*   **Security:** Robust cybersecurity measures to protect smart devices from unauthorized access and to secure the data in transit and at rest.
*   **Data Volume & Velocity:** Managing high volumes of real-time telemetry data requires scalable data infrastructure and processing capabilities.
*   **Data Ownership:** Clear policies defining ownership of data generated by customer-sited devices.
*   **Data Granularity:** Balancing the need for granular data for insights with privacy concerns and storage costs.
*   **Ethical AI Use:** If AI/ML is applied to Smart Device Data, ensuring ethical considerations, transparency, and bias mitigation.
