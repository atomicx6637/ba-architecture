## Executive Summary

This document outlines Quantum Energy's overall operating model, detailing how the organization is structured, operates, and interacts to deliver value to its stakeholders. It defines the key components (People, Process, Organization, Technology, Information) that enable Quantum Energy to fulfill its dual imperative: excelling in regulated utility operations while driving profitable growth in non-regulated advanced energy solutions. The model emphasizes a clear delineation of responsibilities, efficient shared services, and agile delivery for new ventures.

## 1. Introduction & Objectives of the Operating Model

Quantum Energy's operating model describes the blueprint of how the company functions. Its primary objectives are to:
*   Ensure **safe, reliable, and compliant** delivery of regulated utility services.
*   Foster **agility, innovation, and profitability** in non-regulated markets.
*   Achieve **operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness** through optimized processes and shared services.
*   Provide a **seamless and unified customer experience** across all offerings.
*   Support the **strategic objectives** of the enterprise.
*   Attract, develop, and retain a **skilled workforce**.
*   Maintain **regulatory integrity** through clear separation and cost allocation where required.

## 2. Key Components of the Operating Model

### 2.1. People & Organization (Structure & Culture)

*   **Structure:** Hierarchical model (as per `organization-structure.md`) with clear separation of Regulated Operations, Advanced Energy Solutions (AES - Non-Regulated), and Enterprise Services.
    *   **Regulated Operations:** Traditional functional and asset-based structure focused on stability, compliance, and long-term asset management.
    *   **AES Business Unit:** Agile, product-centric structure with empowered teams focused on rapid development, market responsiveness, and customer acquisition.
    *   **Enterprise Services:** Centralized functional structure providing expertise and scale (e.g., HR, Finance, IT, Legal, Strategy).
*   **Culture:** Fostering a safety-first, customer-centric, and innovative culture. Encouraging collaboration between regulated and non-regulated teams where appropriate, while respecting operational boundaries.
*   **Talent:** Emphasis on developing specialized skills for regulated engineering/operations and market-oriented product/sales roles, alongside cross-functional leadership.

### 2.2. Process (Value Streams & Workflows)

*   **Value Streams:** End-to-end delivery processes (as per `ent-value-streams-catalog.md`) that define how value flows to customers and other stakeholders.
    *   **Core Regulated Value Streams:** Emphasize reliability, safety, efficiency, and regulatory compliance (e.g., Electric Energy Delivery, Rate Case & Cost Recovery).
    *   **Non-Regulated Value Streams:** Emphasize speed-to-market, customer acquisition, and service delivery for new offerings (e.g., Smart Home Solution Delivery, EV Charging Deployment).
    *   **Enterprise Value Streams:** Cross-functional processes supporting the entire organization (e.g., Enterprise Strategic Planning, Talent Management).
*   **Process Optimization:** Continuous improvement initiatives to streamline workflows, eliminate waste, and leverage automation across all operations.
*   **Agile Development:** Adoption of agile methodologies for non-regulated product development and IT delivery.

### 2.3. Technology & Systems (Enabling Platforms)

*   **Core Utility Systems:** Robust, reliable, and secure operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT) systems for grid management (SCADA/ADMS/OMS), gas pipeline management, asset management (AMS), and customer information systems (CIS) for regulated services.
*   **Non-Regulated Platforms:** Cloud-native, scalable platforms for smart home management, EV charging networks, DER aggregation, customer relationship management (CRM), and e-commerce for AES.
*   **Enterprise Platforms:** Integrated platforms for ERP (Finance, HR, Procurement), Enterprise Data Platform, and Cybersecurity.
*   **Digitalization:** Prioritizing digital solutions to enhance efficiency, customer experience, and innovation across the enterprise.

### 2.4. Information & Data (Insights & Governance)

*   **Unified Customer View:** Striving for a holistic view of the customer, integrating regulated account data with non-regulated product usage data, while respecting privacy and regulatory boundaries.
*   **Master Data Management (MDM):** Establishing single sources of truth for critical master data (Customer, Premise, Asset, Product) to ensure consistency and accuracy.
*   **Data Governance:** Robust framework for data quality, ownership, security, and privacy, with clear policies for regulated vs. non-regulated data usage.
*   **Advanced Analytics:** Leveraging data from all sources to generate actionable insights for operational optimization, grid management, customer personalization, and market intelligence.

### 2.5. Partners & Ecosystem (Extended Value Chain)

*   **Regulated Suppliers:** Critical vendors for infrastructure, equipment, and fuel.
*   **Non-Regulated Technology Partners:** Manufacturers of smart devices, EV chargers, software platforms.
*   **Channel Partners:** Installers, sales agents for non-regulated offerings.
*   **Academic/Research Partners:** For innovation and R&D in sustainable energy technologies.

## 3. Operating Principles

*   **Safety First, Always:** Paramount in all operations.
*   **Customer-Centric:** Design all processes and solutions with the end-customer in mind.
*   **Integrated Execution:** Foster collaboration across functions and business units, especially at the regulated/non-regulated interface.
*   **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Rely on analytics and facts to inform choices.
*   **Continuous Improvement:** Embrace learning, feedback, and iterative enhancement.
*   **Regulatory Adherence:** Strict compliance with all applicable laws and regulations for utility operations.
*   **Ethical Market Conduct:** Operate with integrity and fairness in competitive non-regulated markets.

## 4. Interfaces & Collaboration

### 4.1. Regulated-Non-Regulated Interface

*   **Customer Interface:** Managed by a unified Customer Engagement & Service capability (L1 Cap 10), providing a consistent brand experience while routing inquiries appropriately.
*   **Operational Interface:** AES solutions (e.g., DERs, EV charging) coordinate with Regulated Operations (e.g., Electric Distribution L1 Cap 8, System Operations & Grid Control L1 Cap 13) for interconnection, grid impact analysis, and dispatch.
*   **Financial & Legal Interface:** Strict separation of financial accounting and legal entities to prevent cross-subsidization and ensure regulatory compliance. Legal and Regulatory Affairs (L1 Caps 3 & 18) play a critical oversight role.
*   **Data Interface:** Governed by clear data sharing agreements and consent management, ensuring necessary data is exchanged for holistic customer view or grid benefits, while protecting privacy and respecting regulatory boundaries.

### 4.2. Shared Services Model

*   **Enterprise Services** provide centralized capabilities (e.g., IT, HR, Finance, Legal, Procurement) to both Regulated Operations and AES.
*   **Service Level Agreements (SLAs):** Established between Enterprise Services and consuming business units to define service expectations, metrics, and costs.
*   **Cost Allocation:** Transparent and auditable methodologies for allocating shared service costs to ensure fairness and regulatory compliance.

---

## 5. Governance & Oversight

*   **Executive Leadership Team (ELT):** Provides strategic direction and resolves high-level conflicts.
*   **BA Steering Committee:** Oversees the evolution of the operating model and its alignment with strategy.
*   **Data Governance Council:** Ensures data quality, privacy, and compliance across the enterprise.
*   **Regular Performance Reviews:** Monitoring of key metrics and KPIs at all levels to assess operating model effectiveness.
