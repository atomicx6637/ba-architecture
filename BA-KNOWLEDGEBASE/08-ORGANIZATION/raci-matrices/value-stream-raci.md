## Executive Summary

This document presents a RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrix for selected stages of Quantum Energy's critical value streams. It clarifies roles and responsibilities for the execution of key activities within these end-to-end processes, ensuring clear ownership and facilitating seamless transitions across functional boundaries. This matrix is particularly valuable for understanding interdependencies between regulated operational processes and non-regulated solution delivery.

## 1. Introduction to RACI for Value Streams

Applying RACI to value stream stages helps to delineate responsibilities across departments and roles involved in delivering specific value to stakeholders. This ensures:
*   Clear ownership for each stage's output.
*   Effective handoffs between teams.
*   Identification of potential bottlenecks or areas requiring improved collaboration.
*   A common understanding of roles throughout complex, cross-functional processes.

## 3. Key Observations & Implications

*   **Clear Value Stream Ownership:** Each value stream has a clear "A" (Accountable) role, typically an executive or senior leader whose organization is primarily responsible for the end-to-end outcome.
*   **Regulated Operations (COO):** The COO is Accountable for core Regulated Operations value streams (e.g., Electric Energy Delivery), emphasizing their critical role in operational execution and reliability.
*   **Non-Regulated Solutions (CDIO):** The CDIO is Accountable for non-regulated value streams (e.g., Smart Home Solution Delivery), driving product-market fit and profitable delivery.
*   **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Many stages show significant "R", "C", or "I" involvement from various departments, highlighting the cross-functional nature of value delivery. For instance, Customer Service (CCO) is "Consulted" or "Responsible" across many regulated customer touchpoints.
*   **Specialized Roles for Execution:** Field Operations Technicians are "Responsible" for regulated physical service installation, while Non-Regulated Solution Installers are "Responsible" for non-regulated device installations.
*   **Legal & Regulatory Oversight:** Legal and Regulatory Affairs (General Counsel, VP Regulatory Affairs) play "Accountable" or "Consulted" roles in highly regulated value streams like Rate Case & Cost Recovery.
*   **Data-Driven Support:** Data Scientists are increasingly "Consulted" or "Responsible" for analytics-driven stages, showing the growing importance of data in all value streams.

## 4. Next Steps

*   **Detailed Stage-Level RACI:** As value streams are further decomposed into more granular stages and tasks, more detailed RACI matrices will be developed to identify specific individual or team responsibilities.
*   **Process Improvement Input:** The RACI matrix can highlight areas of unclear responsibility or potential handoff issues that warrant process improvement initiatives.
*   **Training & Communication:** The matrix will be used in training and communication efforts to ensure all stakeholders understand their roles and responsibilities within key value delivery processes.
