## Executive Summary

This document outlines Quantum Energy's framework and criteria for prioritizing its strategic initiatives. Given finite resources, effective prioritization is critical to ensure that our investments are optimally aligned with our strategic objectives, deliver maximum value, and manage inherent risks across both regulated modernization and non-regulated growth drivers. The framework provides a structured approach to decision-making for the enterprise portfolio.

## 1. Introduction

Strategic initiative prioritization is a continuous process managed by the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) and overseen by the BA Steering Committee. It balances multiple factors to select the initiatives that will yield the greatest overall benefit for Quantum Energy and its stakeholders.

---

## 2. Prioritization Framework & Criteria

Quantum Energy utilizes a multi-criteria decision-making framework, categorizing initiatives by their primary strategic impact (Regulated vs. Non-Regulated) and evaluating them against a common set of criteria.

### 2.1. Strategic Alignment (Weight: 30%)

*   **Description:** How directly and significantly the initiative contributes to Quantum Energy's strategic themes and objectives.
*   **Evaluation Factors:**
    *   **Direct Link to Strategic Objectives:** (High = 5, Low = 1)
    *   **Contribution to Key Strategic Themes:** (High = 5, Low = 1)
    *   **Alignment with Dual Imperative (Regulated Excellence / Non-Regulated Growth):** (High = 5, Low = 1)
    *   **Addresses Critical Capability Gaps:** (High = 5, Low = 1, based on `Capability Gap Analysis`)

### 2.2. Value Potential (Weight: 30%)

*   **Description:** The potential benefits an initiative is expected to deliver to Quantum Energy and its stakeholders.
*   **Evaluation Factors:**
    *   **Regulated Benefits (for Regulated Initiatives):**
        *   SAIDI/SAIFI Reduction, Safety Improvement, Compliance Risk Mitigation, O&M Cost Reduction (Score 1-5).
        *   Ability to secure rate base recovery (High = 5, Low = 1).
    *   **Non-Regulated Benefits (for Non-Regulated Initiatives):**
        *   Revenue Growth, EBITDA Contribution, Market Share Gain (Score 1-5).
        *   Customer Acquisition/Retention, Innovation Leadership (Score 1-5).
    *   **Enterprise Benefits (for All Initiatives):**
        *   Customer Satisfaction (NPS impact), Employee Productivity, ESG Impact (Score 1-5).
        *   Cost Savings/Efficiency Gains (Score 1-5).

### 2.3. Feasibility & Complexity (Weight: 20%)

*   **Description:** The likelihood of successful execution and the complexity involved.
*   **Evaluation Factors:**
    *   **Technical Feasibility:** (High = 5, Low = 1)
    *   **Resource Availability:** (Internal talent, external partners) (High = 5, Low = 1)
    *   **Organizational Readiness:** (Culture, change management capacity) (High = 5, Low = 1)
    *   **External Dependencies:** (Regulatory approvals, supplier readiness) (High = 5, Low = 1)
    *   **Integration Complexity:** (Number of systems, data interfaces) (High = 5, Low = 1)

### 2.4. Risk (Weight: 20%)

*   **Description:** The potential negative consequences or uncertainties associated with an initiative.
*   **Evaluation Factors:**
    *   **Regulatory Risk:** (Compliance risk, political risk) (High = 1, Low = 5)
    *   **Market Risk:** (Competitive response, demand uncertainty) (High = 1, Low = 5)
    *   **Execution Risk:** (Project overruns, technical failure) (High = 1, Low = 5)
    *   **Reputational Risk:** (Public perception) (High = 1, Low = 5)
    *   **Cybersecurity Risk:** (Data breach, system vulnerability) (High = 1, Low = 5)

## 3. Prioritization Process

1.  **Initiative Submission & Definition:** Initiative leads submit proposals with defined scope, objectives, estimated costs, and initial assessments against criteria.
2.  **Strategic Alignment Review:** CSO Office and Business Architecture team verify alignment with strategic objectives and identified capability gaps.
3.  **Cross-Functional Scoring:** A cross-functional team of senior leaders (representing Operations, Finance, Marketing, IT, AES, Regulatory) scores each initiative against the criteria.
4.  **Weighted Score Calculation:** Scores are aggregated using the defined weights for each criterion.
5.  **Portfolio Review & Optimization:** The BA Steering Committee and ELT review the ranked initiatives, considering interdependencies (`ent-initiative-dependencies.md`), resource constraints, and overall portfolio balance. Strategic judgment is applied.
6.  **Approval & Funding:** Approved initiatives are funded and added to the active portfolio.
