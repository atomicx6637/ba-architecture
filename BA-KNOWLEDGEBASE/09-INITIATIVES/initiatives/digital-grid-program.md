## Executive Summary

The Digital Grid Program (DGPR-001) is a cornerstone initiative for Quantum Energy, aimed at transforming our traditional electric and gas distribution networks into an intelligent, adaptive, and highly resilient system. This program will significantly enhance our ability to deliver reliable, safe, and efficient energy, seamlessly integrate distributed energy resources (DERs), and meet evolving regulatory and customer expectations. It is a critical enabler for achieving our "Grid Modernization & Resilience" strategic theme.

## 2. Key Program Components & Deliverables

The Digital Grid Program is structured into several interconnected projects, each delivering specific capabilities:

### 2.1. Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) Deployment (Project A)

*   **Description:** Full deployment of smart electric and gas meters across 100% of Quantum Energy's regulated service territory. This project includes the installation of meters, communication network infrastructure (e.g., RF mesh), and a Meter Data Management System (MDMS).
*   **Key Deliverables:** 100% AMI coverage by 2026, operational MDMS, enhanced remote meter reading, improved outage detection.
*   **Enabling Capabilities:** 9.1 Metering Infrastructure Management, 9.2 Meter Data Collection & Management.

### 2.2. Distribution Automation (DA) & SCADA Modernization (Project B)

*   **Description:** Implementation of advanced distribution automation technologies to improve grid observability, controllability, and self-healing capabilities. This includes deploying intelligent reclosers, fault circuit indicators, voltage regulators, and modernizing SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems for both electric and gas distribution.
*   **Key Deliverables:** ADMS (Advanced Distribution Management System) implementation, FLISR (Fault Location, Isolation, and Service Restoration) functionality, Volt-VAR Optimization (VVO), enhanced SCADA visibility.
*   **Enabling Capabilities:** 8.5 Distribution Automation & Grid Modernization, 9.1 Distribution System Operations & Control (Gas), 13.2 Real-Time System Monitoring & Analysis.

### 2.3. Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS) (Project C)

*   **Description:** Development and implementation of a DERMS platform to monitor, manage, and optimize the performance of distributed energy resources (e.g., rooftop solar, battery storage, EV charging) connected to Quantum Energy's grid. This will enable grid operators to forecast DER impacts, dispatch aggregated DERs for grid services, and maintain grid stability.
