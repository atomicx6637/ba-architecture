**Scope:** Guiding principles for Business Architecture at Quantum Energy

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines the fundamental principles that guide the practice of Business Architecture (BA) at Quantum Energy. These principles ensure consistency, effectiveness, and strategic alignment across all BA activities, particularly in integrating our regulated utility operations with our innovative non-regulated offerings.

## Core Principles

1.  **Strategic Alignment:**
    *   **Principle:** Business Architecture directly supports and enables the realization of Quantum Energy's strategic objectives, bridging the gap between strategy and execution for both regulated and non-regulated businesses.
    *   **Implication:** All architecture artifacts must clearly demonstrate traceability to strategic themes and objectives. Investment decisions will be guided by architectural alignment with strategy.

2.  **Value-Centric:**
    *   **Principle:** Business Architecture focuses on identifying, defining, and optimizing the creation and delivery of value to all stakeholders, including customers, shareholders, regulators, and employees, across both utility services and advanced offerings.
    *   **Implication:** Value streams and their associated value propositions are central to the architecture. Performance metrics are tied to value delivery.

3.  **Capability-Driven:**
    *   **Principle:** Business Architecture describes "what" Quantum Energy does (capabilities) independent of "how" or "who" does it. Capabilities are stable, reusable, and form the primary target of investment and enhancement for the entire enterprise.
    *   **Implication:** The capability model is the foundational framework for understanding the business. Organizational design and initiative planning are informed by capability needs.

4.  **Holistic & Integrated:**
    *   **Principle:** Business Architecture provides an integrated, end-to-end view of Quantum Energy's business, encompassing regulated operations, utility-supporting non-regulated services, and utility-like non-regulated offerings. It considers all BIZBOK domains and their interrelationships.
    *   **Implication:** Architecture artifacts will depict cross-domain relationships and dependencies. Siloed perspectives are challenged to foster a unified enterprise view.

5.  **Regulatory Awareness & Market Agility:**
    *   **Principle:** Business Architecture explicitly recognizes and incorporates the regulatory environment governing utility operations while fostering agility and innovation required for competitive non-regulated markets.
    *   **Implication:** Architectural solutions respect regulatory compliance and reporting needs for regulated assets/services. Non-regulated offerings prioritize market responsiveness and rapid iteration. Boundaries and interactions between regulated and non-regulated entities are clearly defined.

6.  **Actionable & Practical:**
    *   **Principle:** Business Architecture artifacts are designed to be practical, consumable, and actionable, driving decision-making and providing tangible guidance for initiatives and investments.
    *   **Implication:** Architecture models are kept at the appropriate level of detail. Complex concepts are visualized and communicated clearly to diverse audiences.

7.  **Fact-Based & Data-Driven:**
    *   **Principle:** Business Architecture is grounded in data and objective analysis, leveraging insights to inform current state assessments, future state definitions, and impact analyses.
    *   **Implication:** Decisions informed by BA are supported by evidence. Metrics and KPIs are integrated into architectural views.

8.  **Evolutionary & Evergreen:**
    *   **Principle:** Business Architecture is a living discipline, with artifacts continuously evolved, maintained, and updated to reflect changes in Quantum Energy's strategy, operations, technology, and market landscape.
    *   **Implication:** A robust governance framework is in place for review, approval, and maintenance of architecture artifacts. Regular updates ensure currency and relevance.

9.  **Collaborative & Inclusive:**
    *   **Principle:** Business Architecture is developed and sustained through active collaboration with business stakeholders, subject matter experts, and other architectural disciplines (e.g., Enterprise, Solution, Technical Architecture).
    *   **Implication:** Stakeholder engagement is integral to the BA process. Communication and feedback loops are actively managed.
