## Executive Summary

This document provides a high-level overview of the general terms and conditions governing Quantum Energy's non-regulated products and services offered through its Advanced Energy Solutions (AES) business unit. Unlike regulated tariffs, these terms are contractual agreements between Quantum Energy AES and its customers, defining the rights and obligations of both parties for solutions such as smart home energy management, EV charging, and distributed energy resources. These terms are subject to consumer protection laws but are not approved by public utility commissions.
