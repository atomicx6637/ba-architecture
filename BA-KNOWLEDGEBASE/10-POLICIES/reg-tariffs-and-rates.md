## Executive Summary

This document provides a high-level overview of Quantum Energy's regulated tariffs and rates for electric and natural gas services within its primary service territory, the Evergreen State. These tariffs and rates are formally approved by the Evergreen State Public Utility Commission (ESPUC) and define the terms, conditions, and charges under which Quantum Energy provides utility service. They are fundamental to our revenue recovery and directly impact our regulated customers.

## 1. Introduction

Tariffs are official documents filed with and approved by the ESPUC that specify the terms, conditions, and prices for services provided by Quantum Energy. Rates are the specific charges consumers pay for electricity and natural gas, derived from these approved tariffs. These documents are legally binding and form the basis for customer billing.
