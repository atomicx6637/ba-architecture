## Executive Summary

This document outlines the key state-level regulations and acts that significantly impact Quantum Energy's regulated electric and natural gas utility operations within its primary service state (assumed for this document to be "Evergreen State"). Adherence to these regulations is mandatory, and compliance efforts are central to our operational planning, investment strategies, and risk management. Understanding the scope and implications of these state mandates is crucial for maintaining our license to operate and ensuring the safe, reliable, and compliant delivery of energy.
