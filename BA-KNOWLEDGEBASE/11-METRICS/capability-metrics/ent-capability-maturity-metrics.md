## Executive Summary

This document defines the metrics and methodology for tracking the maturity of Quantum Energy's key business capabilities. Measuring capability maturity allows us to monitor progress against our target state, quantify the impact of strategic initiatives, and ensure that our organizational capabilities are evolving to meet strategic objectives. This is particularly important for capabilities that span both regulated and non-regulated operations.

## 1. Introduction

Capability maturity refers to the level of sophistication and institutionalization of a business capability. Quantum Energy uses a simplified 5-level maturity model (Initial, Managed, Defined, Quantitatively Managed, Optimizing). Tracking maturity involves periodically assessing a capability against this model and measuring its progression towards a defined target.

## 2. Capability Maturity Tracking Methodology

### 2.1. Maturity Assessment Scale

Quantum Energy utilizes a 5-level scale for maturity assessment:

*   **Level 1: Initial/Ad Hoc** (Processes are unpredictable, poorly controlled)
*   **Level 2: Managed/Planned** (Basic planning and tracking, some repeatability)
*   **Level 3: Defined/Standardized** (Processes well-characterized, documented, and standard)
*   **Level 4: Quantitatively Managed/Measured** (Processes measured, controlled, and statistically managed)
*   **Level 5: Optimizing** (Continuous process improvement, innovation)

### 2.2. Assessment Criteria

For each capability, maturity is assessed across several dimensions:
*   **Process:** Level of formalization, documentation, and standardization of underlying processes.
*   **People:** Availability of skilled personnel, training, and clear roles/responsibilities.
*   **Technology:** Adequacy and sophistication of enabling systems and tools.
*   **Information:** Availability, quality, and utilization of data for decision-making.
*   **Governance:** Level of oversight, policy enforcement, and continuous improvement.

### 2.3. Assessment Frequency & Ownership

*   **Frequency:** Key capabilities are formally assessed annually, with interim reviews as needed for high-priority transformation initiatives.
*   **Ownership:** Capability Owners (typically senior business leaders) are responsible for their capability's maturity assessment, supported by the Business Architecture team.

## 4. Reporting & Analysis

*   **Capability Roadmaps:** Maturity metrics feed into capability roadmaps, visualizing the planned evolution of capabilities over time.
*   **Heat Maps:** Capability maturity data is used to generate heat maps, providing a quick visual assessment of capability health and areas requiring focus (refer to `../../3-CAPABILITIES/capability-assessments/capability-heat-maps.md`).
*   **Strategic Initiative Impact:** Progress in capability maturity is a key indicator of the success of strategic initiatives aimed at capability enhancement.
*   **Intervention Triggers:** Significant gaps or slow progress in critical capabilities may trigger additional investment, process redesign, or organizational adjustments.
