## Executive Summary

This document outlines Quantum Energy's enterprise-level Balanced Scorecard (BSC). The BSC provides a holistic framework for measuring and managing organizational performance across four key perspectives: Financial, Customer, Internal Business Process, and Learning & Growth. It integrates metrics from both our regulated utility operations and non-regulated advanced energy solutions, ensuring a balanced focus on long-term value creation and achievement of our dual imperative strategic objectives.
