## 3. Linkage to Strategic Objectives and Initiatives

*   Each benefit metric directly maps to one or more of Quantum Energy's strategic objectives, ensuring the initiative contributes to the highest-level corporate goals.
*   These metrics are used in the [Enterprise Value Realization Tracking](../../9-INITIATIVES/ent-value-realization-tracking.md) framework to monitor the success of the overall strategic portfolio.
*   Benefit owners, typically executive sponsors or their delegates, are accountable for realizing these benefits post-initiative completion.

---

## 4. Reporting and Analysis

*   **Frequency:** Metrics are tracked and reported at the frequency appropriate for the benefit (monthly, quarterly, annually).
*   **Dashboards:** Dedicated dashboards will visualize benefit realization progress against targets, identifying variances.
*   **Reviews:** Regular reviews by the ELT and BA Steering Committee will assess overall portfolio benefits, making decisions on sustainment, course correction, or termination of initiatives.
*   **Post-Implementation Review:** For each major initiative, a formal Post-Implementation Review will quantify the benefits actually achieved against those planned.
