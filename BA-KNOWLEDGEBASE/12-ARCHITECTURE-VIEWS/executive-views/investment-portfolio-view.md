## 2. Quantum Energy Investment Portfolio Allocation (Conceptual)

This view categorizes investments based on their primary strategic driver and regulatory scope.

    title Quantum Energy Investment Portfolio (2025-2030 CAPEX + Strategic OPEX)
    "Regulated Infrastructure Modernization (e.g., Grid, Gas Safety)" : 45
    "Non-Regulated Growth & Innovation (e.g., AES Products)" : 25
    "Enterprise-wide Digital Transformation (e.g., CX, Data Platform)" : 15
    "Baseline Sustaining Capital (Regulated Assets)" : 10
    "ESG & Strategic R&D (Cross-cutting)" : 5
```

**Interpretation:**
*   **Regulated Infrastructure Modernization (45%):** Largest share, reflecting ongoing commitment to reliability, safety, and compliance of core utility operations (e.g., DGPR-001). This includes investments in distribution automation, AMI, and pipeline integrity.
*   **Non-Regulated Growth & Innovation (25%):** Significant portion dedicated to scaling AES business, new product development, and market expansion (e.g., AES-G1, NEST-001). This reflects the strategic imperative for diversification.
*   **Enterprise-wide Digital Transformation (15%):** Investments in foundational platforms and capabilities that benefit the entire enterprise (e.g., UCE-001, CDP-001, WFD-001). These drive efficiency and enhance customer experience across all segments.
*   **Baseline Sustaining Capital (10%):** Ongoing, essential capital for maintaining existing regulated assets, distinct from modernization efforts.
*   **ESG & Strategic R&D (5%):** Smaller but critical investments in long-term sustainability initiatives and R&D for future energy solutions.
