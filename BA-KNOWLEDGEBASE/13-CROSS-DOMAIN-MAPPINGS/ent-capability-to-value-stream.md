## Executive Summary

This document provides a crucial mapping between Quantum Energy's business capabilities and the value streams they enable. Understanding how "what we do" (capabilities) facilitates "how we deliver value" (value streams) is fundamental for optimizing processes, identifying capability investment needs, and ensuring that our operational functions effectively support the delivery of both regulated utility services and non-regulated advanced energy solutions.

## 1. Introduction to Mapping Methodology

This mapping links Quantum Energy's Level 1 Capabilities (from `ent-capabilities-l1-l2.md`) to the Value Streams (from `ent-value-streams-catalog.md`) that they primarily enable. The relationship is indicated as either "Primary" or "Secondary":

*   **Primary (P):** The capability is fundamental and critical for the successful execution of the value stream, enabling multiple stages or a core function.
*   **Secondary (S):** The capability provides important support, data, or governance to the value stream, enabling specific stages or contributing to its overall effectiveness.

The mapping distinguishes capabilities and value streams by their primary scope (Regulated, Non-Regulated, or Enterprise) to illustrate the integrated nature of Quantum Energy's business model.

## 3. Key Observations & Implications

*   **Core Utility Capabilities are Foundational:** Regulated capabilities like `Electric Distribution`, `Gas Distribution`, `Energy Generation`, and `Natural Gas Supply & Storage` are primary enablers for core regulated value streams (AOV-04, AOV-05, RCV-01).
*   **Customer Engagement is Cross-Cutting:** `Customer Engagement & Service` is a primary enabler for all customer-facing value streams (RCV-xx and NCV-xx), highlighting the unified approach to customer experience.
*   **Non-Regulated Capabilities Drive New Value Streams:** `Non-Regulated Product Development` and `Non-Regulated Sales & Marketing` are primary enablers for all non-regulated customer value streams (NCV-xx) and advanced market participation (SMV-xx).
*   **System Operations is Enterprise-Wide:** `System Operations & Grid Control` is a primary enabler not only for core energy delivery (AOV-04, AOV-05) but also for integrating and optimizing DERs within SMV-03.
*   **Shared Services Enable All:** Enterprise-wide supporting capabilities (e.g., Financial Management, IT, Procurement) enable numerous value streams across both regulated and non-regulated segments.
*   **Interdependencies:** This mapping clarifies how capabilities must mature to improve value stream performance, driving capability investment prioritization.
