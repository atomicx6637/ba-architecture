## Executive Summary

This document provides a crucial mapping between Quantum Energy's value streams and the stakeholders who trigger and receive value from them. Understanding "whom we serve" and "who initiates" each end-to-end process is fundamental for clarifying the purpose and beneficiaries of our value delivery mechanisms. This mapping highlights the diverse stakeholder ecosystem Quantum Energy serves across both regulated utility operations and non-regulated advanced energy solutions.

## 1. Introduction to Mapping Methodology

This mapping links Quantum Energy's Value Streams (from `ent-value-streams-catalog.md`) to the specific Stakeholder segments (from `ent-stakeholder-catalog.md`) that:

*   **Trigger (T):** The primary stakeholder who initiates the value stream.
*   **Receive Value (R):** The primary stakeholder who benefits from or is the intended recipient of the value stream's outcome.

The mapping distinguishes value streams and stakeholders by their primary scope (Regulated, Non-Regulated, or Enterprise) to illustrate the integrated nature of Quantum Energy's business model.

## 3. Key Observations & Implications

*   **Diverse Triggers & Beneficiaries:** Value streams are initiated by various internal and external stakeholders, and similarly, deliver value to a broad range of recipients.
*   **Customer-Centricity:** A significant number of value streams are directly triggered by or deliver value to customers (both regulated and non-regulated), underscoring Quantum Energy's customer-centric focus.
*   **Internal Value Creation:** Many enterprise and operational value streams primarily deliver value internally to Quantum Energy itself, ensuring its financial health, operational efficiency, and long-term sustainability.
*   **Regulatory Loop:** Value streams like Rate Case & Cost Recovery (REV-01) highlight the direct interaction between Quantum Energy, Customers, and Regulators.
*   **Non-Regulated Market Dynamics:** Non-regulated value streams are directly triggered by and deliver value to non-regulated customers, showcasing Quantum Energy's market-driven approach in this segment.
*   **Ecosystem Approach:** This mapping emphasizes the interconnectedness of Quantum Energy's operations with its broader stakeholder ecosystem.
