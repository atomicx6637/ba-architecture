## Executive Summary

This document defines the quality standards for all Business Architecture (BA) artifacts created and maintained by Quantum Energy. Adherence to these standards is paramount for ensuring the accuracy, consistency, completeness, and fitness for purpose of our business blueprint. High-quality BA artifacts are essential for effective strategic planning, operational execution, regulatory compliance, and driving innovation across both regulated utility operations and non-regulated advanced energy solutions.

## 1. Introduction

Quality in Business Architecture refers to the degree to which our artifacts meet the needs of their stakeholders and adhere to established standards. These standards guide the creation, maintenance, and usage of all BA models and documentation.

## 2. Core BA Quality Dimensions

Quantum Energy evaluates the quality of its BA artifacts against the following dimensions:

### 2.1. Accuracy

*   **Definition:** The degree to which an artifact correctly reflects the actual or intended state of Quantum Energy's business (e.g., capabilities, value streams, products, policies).
*   **Standards:**
    *   All factual statements must be verifiable with authoritative sources.
    *   Models must accurately represent the business reality or target state.
    *   No known errors or contradictions within the artifact.
*   **Measurement/Verification:** Stakeholder validation workshops, expert review, cross-referencing with source documentation.

### 2.2. Completeness

*   **Definition:** The degree to which an artifact contains all necessary information to fulfill its stated purpose and address the concerns of its target audience.
*   **Standards:**
    *   All mandatory attributes (as defined in `ba-standards.md` and artifact templates) must be populated.
    *   No critical information is missing or omitted.
    *   Scope boundaries are clearly defined.
*   **Measurement/Verification:** Checklist adherence, peer review, target audience feedback.

### 2.3. Consistency

*   **Definition:** The degree to which an artifact aligns with other related artifacts (e.g., definitions, naming conventions, relationships) and adheres to Quantum Energy's overall BA metamodel.
*   **Standards:**
    *   Consistent use of terminology (referencing `ba-glossary.md`).
    *   Adherence to `ba-standards.md` (e.g., naming conventions, notation).
    *   Relationships between elements (e.g., Capability to Value Stream) are logically sound and reflected in mapping documents.
    *   No contradictions between different artifacts.
*   **Measurement/Verification:** Cross-referencing, automated consistency checks (where tools allow), peer review.

### 2.4. Clarity

*   **Definition:** The degree to which an artifact is easy to understand, unambiguous, and effectively communicates its intended message to its target audience.
*   **Standards:**
    *   Use of clear, concise language (avoiding jargon where possible or defining it in `ba-glossary.md`).
    *   Models and diagrams are well-formatted, visually clean, and follow established notation.
    *   Content is logically structured with appropriate headings and formatting.
*   **Measurement/Verification:** Readability scores, target audience comprehension testing, feedback sessions.

### 2.5. Timeliness & Currency

*   **Definition:** The degree to which an artifact is up-to-date and reflects the most current state of the business or target architecture.
*   **Standards:**
    *   Adherence to `ba-review-cycles.md`.
    *   Changes are incorporated promptly following the `ba-change-management.md` process.
    *   Version control information is accurate.
*   **Measurement/Verification:** Audit of review dates, verification against change logs.

### 2.6. Fitness for Purpose (Relevance)

*   **Definition:** The degree to which an artifact effectively supports the business needs and decision-making for which it was created.
*   **Standards:**
    *   The artifact addresses the concerns of its target audience (as defined in `ent-viewpoint-catalog.md`).
    *   Provides actionable insights relevant to strategic objectives or operational challenges.
*   **Measurement/Verification:** Stakeholder satisfaction surveys, utilization rates (e.g., how often is the artifact referenced in key meetings), post-implementation review of initiatives.

## 3. Quality Assurance & Control Process

Quantum Energy's BA Quality Assurance and Control Process is integrated into the artifact lifecycle:

1.  **Peer Review:** All BA artifacts undergo peer review by other Business Architects for adherence to standards and metamodel consistency.
2.  **Stakeholder Validation:** Draft artifacts are validated with relevant business stakeholders and subject matter experts (SMEs) for accuracy and completeness.
3.  **BA Review Board (BARB) Approval:** The BARB (as defined in `ba-governance.md`) reviews and approves artifacts, focusing on overall quality, strategic alignment, and cross-domain consistency.
4.  **Automated Checks:** Leveraging tools (where available) for consistency checks, broken links, and adherence to structural standards.
5.  **Audit & Feedback:** Periodic audits of published artifacts and a feedback mechanism for stakeholders to report quality issues.

## 4. Roles & Responsibilities

*   **Head of Business Architecture:** Accountable for overall BA quality and adherence to these standards.
*   **Business Architects:** Responsible for creating high-quality artifacts and ensuring they meet standards.
*   **BA Review Board:** Responsible for approving artifacts and ensuring quality before publication.
*   **Data Governance Council:** Provides input and oversight on information-related aspects of BA artifacts.
