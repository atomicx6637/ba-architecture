## Executive Summary

This document provides a crucial link between Quantum Energy's strategic objectives and the underlying business capabilities required to achieve them. By mapping objectives to capabilities, we identify which capabilities are critical for strategic success, where investments are needed, and how our regulated and non-regulated operations collectively contribute to our overall vision. This mapping highlights strategic dependencies and informs our capability development roadmap.

## 1. Introduction to Mapping Methodology

This mapping utilizes Quantum Energy's L1/L2 Enterprise Capability Model (defined in `ent-capabilities-l1-l2.md`) and links it to the Strategic Objectives outlined in `ent-strategic-objectives.md`. The mapping indicates a "Primary" or "Secondary" relationship:

*   **Primary (P):** The capability is absolutely essential for achieving the objective; significant enhancement or new development of this capability is required.
*   **Secondary (S):** The capability contributes significantly to the objective but may not require major new investment, or it enables a supporting aspect of the objective.

The mapping distinguishes between Regulated (Reg), Non-Regulated (NonReg), and Enterprise (Ent) capabilities where applicable, reflecting Quantum Energy's dual imperative.
