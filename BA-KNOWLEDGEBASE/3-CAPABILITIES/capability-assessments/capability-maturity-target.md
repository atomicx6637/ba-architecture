## 1. Capability Maturity Model (Simplified)

Quantum Energy employs a simplified 5-level maturity model for its business capabilities, adapted from common industry frameworks (e.g., CMMI). The definitions are consistent with those in `capability-maturity-current.md`.

*   **Level 1: Initial/Ad Hoc**
*   **Level 2: Managed/Planned**
*   **Level 3: Defined/Standardized**
*   **Level 4: Quantitatively Managed/Measured**
*   **Level 5: Optimizing**
