## 1. Capability Definition

**Capability Name:** Regulated Overhead Line Maintenance
**Capability ID:** 8.2.1
**Scope:** Regulated (Electric Distribution)
**Description:** The capability to perform routine and emergency inspection, repair, and replacement of all components of Quantum Energy's overhead electric distribution lines, including conductors, poles, crossarms, insulators, hardware, and associated protective devices. This capability ensures compliance with safety standards, regulatory requirements, and maintains service reliability for customers.
