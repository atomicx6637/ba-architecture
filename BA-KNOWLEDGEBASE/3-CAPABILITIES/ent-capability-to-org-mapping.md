## Executive Summary

This document provides a conceptual overview of the mapping between Quantum Energy's business capabilities and its primary organizational units. Understanding "who owns what" in terms of capabilities is crucial for clarity in roles and responsibilities, avoiding duplication, and facilitating strategic alignment. This mapping explicitly considers the distinct nature of our regulated utility operations, non-regulated advanced energy solutions, and enterprise-wide shared service functions.

## 1. Introduction to Capability-to-Organization Mapping

Capability-to-Organization mapping identifies which organizational unit(s) are primarily responsible for executing or owning a given business capability. It is important to note:
*   **Capabilities are stable; organizations may change.** The mapping illustrates how a flexible organizational structure can execute a stable set of business capabilities.
*   **Multiple organizations may contribute** to a single capability, but typically one is the "primary owner" or "accountable" party.
*   This is a **conceptual L1/L2 mapping**. Detailed L3 capabilities would map to specific departments, teams, or roles (often captured in RACI matrices).

## 2. Key Organizational Units (Conceptual)

For the purpose of this mapping, we define the following high-level organizational units within Quantum Energy:

*   **Regulated Operations Division:** Encompasses Generation, Transmission, Electric Distribution, and Gas Distribution for core utility services.
*   **Customer & Regulatory Affairs:** Manages customer engagement for regulated services, billing, and all regulatory/government interactions.
*   **Advanced Energy Solutions (AES) Business Unit:** Quantum Energy's non-regulated entity focused on product development, sales, and delivery of advanced energy solutions (e.g., smart home, EV, distributed generation).
*   **Enterprise Services:** Shared corporate functions including Finance, Human Resources, Information Technology, Legal, Procurement, and Strategic Planning.

## 3. Capability to Organization Mapping (L1 Capabilities)

The table below provides a conceptual mapping of Quantum Energy's Level 1 capabilities to the primary owning organizational units.

| L1 Capability | Capability Scope | Primary Owning Organization(s) | Key Contributing Organization(s) |
| :---------------------------------------------- | :--------------- | :----------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| **1. Enterprise Strategy & Performance Management** | Ent | Enterprise Services (Strategic Planning) | All Divisions/BUs |
| **2. Market Development & Competitive Intelligence** | Ent | Enterprise Services (Strategic Planning), AES Business Unit | Customer & Regulatory Affairs |
| **3. Regulatory & Government Affairs** | Reg | Customer & Regulatory Affairs | Regulated Operations Division, Enterprise Services (Legal) |
| **4. Brand & Reputation Management** | Ent | Customer & Regulatory Affairs (Corporate Communications), AES Business Unit (Marketing) | All Divisions/BUs |
| **5. Energy Generation** | Reg | Regulated Operations Division | Enterprise Services (Procurement, IT), Customer & Regulatory Affairs |
| **6. Natural Gas Supply & Storage** | Reg | Regulated Operations Division | Enterprise Services (Procurement, IT), Customer & Regulatory Affairs |

## 4. Key Observations & Implications

*   **Shared Enterprise Capabilities:** Many supporting capabilities (e.g., Financial Management, IT, HR, Legal) are housed within Enterprise Services, functioning as shared services for both regulated and non-regulated business units. This drives efficiency and consistency.
*   **Integrated Customer Capabilities:** `Customer Engagement & Service` (L1 Cap 10) is an enterprise capability, reflecting the need for a unified customer experience across all offerings, with contributions from both the Customer & Regulatory Affairs and the AES Business Unit.
*   **Distinct Non-Regulated Focus:** The AES Business Unit explicitly owns `Non-Regulated Product Development` (L1 Cap 11) and `Non-Regulated Sales & Marketing` (L1 Cap 12), ensuring dedicated focus and agility for these growth areas.
*   **Interdependencies:** Capabilities like `System Operations & Grid Control` (L1 Cap 13) are primarily owned by Regulated Operations but have critical interdependencies with the AES Business Unit (e.g., for integrating non-regulated DERs into grid operations). This requires strong cross-functional collaboration.
*   **Regulatory Separation:** The mapping highlights capabilities primarily residing within regulated divisions (e.g., `Energy Generation`, `Electric Distribution`), emphasizing the need for clear operational and financial separation from non-regulated activities to ensure compliance.

## 5. Next Steps

*   **Detailed RACI Matrices:** For critical L2/L3 capabilities, develop detailed RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrices to clarify roles at a more granular level.
*   **Operating Model Design:** Utilize this mapping to inform the design and evolution of Quantum Energy's operating model, optimizing for both efficiency in regulated operations and agility in non-regulated markets.
*   **Resource Planning:** Inform resource allocation and staffing decisions based on capability ownership and the required skill sets.
