## Executive Summary

This document details the stages of the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) value stream (ESV-05). This value stream describes the holistic, top-down process by which Quantum Energy identifies, assesses, mitigates, and monitors its most significant risks across all categories—strategic, operational, financial, and compliance. A mature ERM process is essential for protecting company value, ensuring resiliency, and enabling risk-informed decision-making.

## 1. Value Stream Context

**Value Stream ID:** ESV-05
**Name:** Enterprise Risk Management
**Description:** Identify, assess, mitigate, and monitor enterprise risks across all risk categories to protect organizational value and resilience.

**Entry Criteria:**
-   The periodic enterprise risk assessment cycle is initiated.
-   A new, significant risk is identified through a management or board-level discussion.
-   A major risk event occurs, triggering a response and re-assessment.

**Exit Criteria:**
-   The company's top enterprise risks are identified, assessed, and have clear ownership.
-   Risk mitigation plans are developed and actively managed.
-   Risk monitoring and reporting are occurring on a defined cadence.
-   The overall enterprise risk exposure is understood and managed within the board-approved risk appetite.

## 2. Value Stream Stages and Enabling Capabilities

| Stage ID | Stage Name | Description | Enabling Capabilities (L2 Examples) | Expected Inputs | Expected Outputs | Key Metrics |
| :------- | :--------- | :---------- | :---------------------------------- | :-------------- | :--------------- | :---------- |
| **ESV-05.1** | **Risk Governance & Framework Management** | Establish and maintain the overall ERM framework, policies, and risk appetite statement, as approved by the Board of Directors. | *   17.2 Enterprise Strategy Development (Risk Appetite) | Board directives, COSO/ISO standards | ERM Framework, Risk Appetite Statement | Framework completeness, Board approval |
| **ESV-05.2** | **Risk Identification & Assessment** | Systematically identify potential risks across the enterprise through workshops, interviews, and analysis. Assess each risk based on its likelihood and potential impact. | *   17.4 Enterprise Performance Management (Risk Assessment) | Business unit input, External trends | Enterprise Risk Register, Risk heat map | Number of risks identified, Risk assessment consistency |
| **ESV-05.3** | **Risk Prioritization & Response Planning** | Prioritize the identified risks based on the assessment scores. For each top risk, determine the appropriate response strategy (avoid, mitigate, transfer, accept). | *   17.2 Enterprise Strategy Development | Risk heat map, Risk appetite | Prioritized risk list, Risk response plans | Risk prioritization alignment, Completeness of response plans |
| **ESV-05.4** | **Mitigation & Control Implementation** | Implement the specific actions, controls, or projects required to execute the chosen risk response strategy. This work is typically carried out by the business units who own the risk. | *   14.4 Internal Audit & Controls | Risk response plans | Implemented controls, Mitigation projects | Mitigation plan progress to completion (%), Control effectiveness |
| **ESV-05.5** | **Key Risk Indicator (KRI) Monitoring** | For each top risk, establish and monitor Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)—leading indicators that signal a change in the risk exposure. | *   17.4 Enterprise Performance Management | Risk response plans | KRI dashboards, KRI trend analysis | KRI coverage of top risks, KRI threshold breaches |
| **ESV-06.6** | **Risk Reporting & Communication** | Consolidate risk information and report on the overall enterprise risk profile, top risks, and mitigation plan status to management and the Board. | *   17.4 Enterprise Performance Management | KRI dashboards, Mitigation plan status | Risk reports for management/Board | Report timeliness, Report clarity and actionability |
| **ESV-06.7** | **Risk Culture & Continuous Improvement** | Promote a culture of risk awareness throughout the organization. Review and improve the ERM framework and processes based on lessons learned. | *   15.1 Human Capital Strategy & Planning (Culture) | Lessons learned, Audit findings | Training programs, Updated ERM framework | Risk awareness survey scores, ERM maturity score |

## 3. Cross-Value Stream Dependencies

*   **ESV-05** provides a critical input to **ESV-01 Enterprise Strategic Planning & Execution**, as strategy must be informed by risk.
*   It oversees risks that manifest in all other value streams. For example, it governs the framework for managing commodity price risk in **SMV-01/02**, cybersecurity risk in **ESV-04**, and safety risk in **AOV-03**.
*   It works with **ESV-03 Financial Management & Reporting** to ensure financial risks are managed and disclosed properly.
*   It relies on **ESV-04** to provide the technology platforms (GRC systems) to manage the ERM process itself.
