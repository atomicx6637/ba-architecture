# ESV-07: Demand Management Value Stream (ServiceNow Aligned)

This document outlines the stages of the Demand Management value stream, aligned with a standard ServiceNow workflow. This process governs the lifecycle of a demand from idea to approval, ensuring strategic alignment and proper evaluation before it becomes a project, program, or enhancement. The Enterprise Architecture (EA) team is the primary manager of this value stream.

## Value Stream Stages

| Stage | Description | Entry Criteria | Key Activities | Deliverables | Exit Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Draft** | An idea or request is captured and defined by a stakeholder. It is a working state before formal submission. | An idea or business need is identified. | - Stakeholder captures initial idea, problem, or opportunity.<br>- Basic information is gathered (e.g., description, submitter, business unit).<br>- High-level outcomes are articulated. | Initial Demand Record | The demand has enough information to be formally submitted for review. |
| **2. Submitted** | The demand is formally submitted into the demand pipeline for an initial review. This is the first official entry point. | The demand form is complete from the 'Draft' stage and ready for formal review. | - Submitter finalizes the demand form.<br>- Demand is entered into the queue.<br>- An owner (typically from the EA team) is assigned for screening. | Submitted Demand Record (in queue) | The demand is formally logged and awaiting review. |
| **3. Screening** | The EA team performs a high-level assessment to check for completeness, strategic alignment, and potential duplication. | A demand has been formally submitted and assigned to the EA team for review. | - EA reviews submission for clarity and completeness.<br>- High-level alignment with business capabilities and strategy is checked.<br>- Determine if the demand is a duplicate or part of an existing initiative.<br>- Reject, defer, or return for more information if needed. | - Screening Assessment<br>- Updated Demand Record (status: Screened or Rejected) | The demand is deemed viable and worthy of further analysis. |
| **4. Qualified** | The demand is elaborated with a formal business case, and detailed assessments are performed to create a robust proposal for investment. | The demand has successfully passed the 'Screening' stage. | - Develop a detailed business case, including cost, benefit, risk, and ROI analysis.<br>- EA develops high-level solution and architecture assessment.<br>- EPMO provides high-level resource and timeline estimates.<br>- Stakeholders are engaged to validate assumptions and scope. | - Business Case<br>- High-Level Solution Assessment<br>- Updated Demand Record (status: Qualified) | A complete business case and architectural assessment are ready for portfolio-level review. |
| **5. Approved** | The qualified demand is evaluated against other competing demands, and a governance body makes a formal funding and prioritization decision. | A qualified demand with a complete business case is ready for a governance decision. | - Demand is scored and ranked within the investment portfolio.<br>- EA presents the business case and strategic alignment to the governance committee.<br>- Funding is allocated and the initiative is placed on the enterprise roadmap.<br>- Decision is communicated to stakeholders. | - Scored Portfolio List<br>- Governance Decision Record<br>- Updated Enterprise Roadmap | The demand is officially approved, funded, and converted into a project, program, or enhancement. |
| **6. Completed** | The approved demand is formally handed off to the execution team (e.g., EPMO) to be managed as a project. The demand lifecycle is now complete. | An approved and funded demand is ready to be transitioned to an execution team. | - Create the project shell in the project management system.<br>- Formally transition ownership from the EA/Demand Manager to the EPMO/Project Manager.<br>- All artifacts (business case, architectural assessment) are attached to the new project record. | - Project Record (in PM system)<br>- Completed Demand Record<br>- Handoff Sign-off | The demand record is closed, and a corresponding project record is created and in the 'Initiating' state. |
