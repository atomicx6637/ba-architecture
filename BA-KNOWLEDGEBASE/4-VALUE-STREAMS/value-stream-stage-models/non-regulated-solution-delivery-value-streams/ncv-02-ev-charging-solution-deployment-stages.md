*   Installation may require coordination with **AOV-03 Work & Outage Management** if significant electrical work is needed.
*   The impact of new EV charging load may be an input for planning in **AOV-04 Electric Energy Delivery**.
*   Aggregated charging loads could be a resource for **SMV-03 Distributed Energy Resource (DER) Aggregation & Optimization**.
*   Customer support for these non-regulated products may be handled by the same infrastructure as **RCV-02 Regulated Customer Service Delivery**, requiring clear differentiation.
