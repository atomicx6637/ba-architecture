## Executive Summary

This document details the stages of the Distributed Generation (DG) & Storage Solution Provision value stream (NCV-03). This process covers the end-to-end cycle of selling, designing, installing, and interconnecting on-site energy solutions like rooftop solar and battery storage for residential and commercial customers. This value stream is central to Quantum Energy's strategy of empowering customers and leveraging decentralized energy resources.

## 1. Value Stream Context

**Value Stream ID:** NCV-03
**Name:** Distributed Generation (DG) & Storage Solution Provision
**Description:** Design, propose, install, and maintain distributed generation (e.g., rooftop solar) and energy storage solutions for residential and commercial customers.

**Entry Criteria:**
-   A customer expresses interest in a solar or energy storage solution.
-   A preliminary site assessment (e.g., roof condition, sun exposure) is positive.
-   The customer qualifies for specific offerings and financing.

**Exit Criteria:**
-   The DG and/or storage solution is sold, fully installed, and has passed all inspections.
-   The system is successfully interconnected with the Quantum Energy grid.
-   The customer is onboarded to any monitoring platforms and understands the system's operation.
-   Customer satisfaction with the non-regulated product is confirmed.

## 2. Value Stream Stages and Enabling Capabilities

| Stage ID | Stage Name | Description | Enabling Capabilities (L2 Examples) | Expected Inputs | Expected Outputs | Key Metrics |
| :------- | :--------- | :---------- | :---------------------------------- | :-------------- | :--------------- | :---------- |
| **NCV-03.1** | **Lead Qualification & Energy Analysis** | Qualify sales leads and analyze the customer's historical energy usage and site characteristics to determine feasibility and potential savings. | *   2.2 Non-Regulated Marketing | Customer inquiry, Customer energy bills | Qualified lead, Preliminary energy analysis | Lead-to-proposal ratio, Analysis accuracy |
| **NCV-03.2** | **System Design & Proposal Generation** | Design a custom DG/storage system based on the customer's energy goals and site specifics. Generate a detailed proposal including system layout, cost, and projected savings. | *   2.1 Non-Regulated Product Management | Energy analysis, Site specifics | System design, Financial projections, Customer proposal | Proposal generation time, Design efficiency |
| **NCV-03.3** | **Financing & Contract Closure** | Finalize system design, secure financing for the customer if applicable, and execute the contract for sale and installation. | *   2.3 Non-Regulated Sales | Customer proposal, Customer approval | Signed contract, Financing agreement, Sales order | Contract close rate, Financing approval rate |
| **NCV-03.4** | **Permitting & Interconnection Application** | Prepare and submit all necessary construction permits to the local jurisdiction and the formal interconnection application to the regulated utility division. | *   14.6 Regulatory Strategy & Management | System design, Sales order | Approved permits, Approved interconnection agreement | Permit approval time, Interconnection queue time |
| **NCV-03.5** | **Procurement & Installation** | Procure all necessary equipment (panels, inverters, batteries) and execute the physical installation of the system at the customer's site. | *   15.4 Sourcing & Procurement | Approved permits, Bill of materials | Installed DG/storage system | On-time delivery, Installation quality, Safety incidents |
| | | | *   10.2 Field Service & Work Management | | | |
| **NCV-03.6** | **Inspection, Commissioning & Interconnection** | Coordinate and pass final inspection from the local authority. Commission the system to ensure it operates correctly and complete the final steps for grid interconnection. | *   12.5 Construction & Commissioning | Installed system | Passed inspection, Commissioning report, Permission to operate (PTO) | Inspection pass rate, Time from install to PTO |
| **NCV-03.7** | **System Activation & Customer Onboarding** | Energize the system upon receiving permission to operate. Onboard the customer to the monitoring platform and provide final documentation and training. | *   1.1 Customer Relationship Management | Permission to operate | Activated system, Trained customer | Onboarding satisfaction, System uptime |

## 3. Cross-Value Stream Dependencies

*   This value stream has a critical dependency on the regulated utility side for grid interconnection, a process managed by **AOV-04 Electric Energy Delivery**.
*   The installed assets become part of the portfolio that can be leveraged by **SMV-03 Distributed Energy Resource (DER) Aggregation & Optimization**.
*   Financing and billing for these systems are separate from **RCV-03 Regulated Billing & Payment** but may cause customer confusion, requiring clarity from **RCV-02 Regulated Customer Service Delivery**.
*   The entire process is contingent on interconnection rules governed by **REV-02 Regulatory Compliance & Reporting**.
