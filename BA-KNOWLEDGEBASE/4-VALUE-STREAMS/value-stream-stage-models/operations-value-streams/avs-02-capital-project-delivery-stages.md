## Executive Summary

This document details the stages of the Capital Project Delivery value stream (AVS-02) for Quantum Energy. This value stream encompasses the end-to-end process of planning, designing, executing, and commissioning large-scale capital projects required to expand, upgrade, or replace critical energy infrastructure. Effectively managing this value stream is essential for prudent capital investment, ensuring long-term system reliability, and achieving regulatory cost recovery.

## 1. Value Stream Context

**Value Stream ID:** AVS-02
**Name:** Capital Project Delivery
**Description:** The complete lifecycle for executing capital projects, from initial identification and business case development through to construction, commissioning, and final handover to operational teams.

**Entry Criteria:**
-   A specific infrastructure need (e.g., replacement, upgrade, new capacity) is identified and prioritized.
-   The capital budget for the project is approved.
-   Required regulatory approvals (e.g., Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity) are obtained or in process.

**Exit Criteria:**
-   The project is physically and functionally complete and has passed all commissioning tests.
-   The newly created or modified asset is formally placed in service.
-   All project documentation is finalized, and financial records are closed.
-   Regulatory filings for inclusion in the rate base are completed.

## 3. Cross-Value Stream Dependencies

*   **AVS-02 Capital Project Delivery** is the primary mechanism for executing the plans developed in **AVS-01 Asset Lifecycle Management**.
*   It creates the infrastructure necessary for **AVS-04 Electric Energy Delivery** and **AVS-05 Natural Gas Delivery**.
*   This value stream is a key input into **RVS-01 Rate Case and Cost Recovery**, as it generates the capital costs that require recovery.
*   It often requires significant engagement with **RVS-03 Stakeholder Engagement and Communications** for large, community-impacting projects.
