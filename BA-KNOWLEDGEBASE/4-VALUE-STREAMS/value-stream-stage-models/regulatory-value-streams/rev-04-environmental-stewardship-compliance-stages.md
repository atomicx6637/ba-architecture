| :------- | :--------- | :---------- | :---------------------------------- | :-------------- | :--------------- | :---------- |
| **REV-04.1** | **Environmental Requirements & Permitting** | Identify all environmental requirements for a project or facility.

| **REV-04.3** | **Environmental Monitoring & Data Collection** | Conduct required environmental monitoring, including taking physical samples (air, water), reading continuous emissions monitors, and tracking waste manifests. | *   14.8 Environmental & Safety Compliance | Monitoring schedule, Field observations | Environmental data, Monitoring reports | On-time sampling, Data accuracy |
| **REV-04.4** | **Performance Analysis & Reporting** | Analyze monitoring data to assess compliance and track performance against sustainability goals (e.g., emissions reduction).

## 3. Cross-Value Stream Dependencies

*   **REV-04** is a critical gatekeeper for **AOV-02 Capital Project Delivery**, which cannot proceed without the necessary environmental permits.
*   It sets operating constraints for asset-heavy value streams like **AOV-04 Electric Energy Delivery** (e.g., emissions limits) and **AOV-05 Natural Gas Delivery** (e.g., methane leak detection).
*   Compliance performance and sustainability initiatives are key topics for **REV-03 External Stakeholder Engagement**, particularly with investors and community groups.
*   Fines or remediation costs resulting from this value stream impact **ESV-03 Financial Management & Reporting**.
