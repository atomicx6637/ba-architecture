## Executive Summary

This document details the stages of the Non-Regulated Energy Market Participation value stream (SMV-04). This value stream is focused exclusively on leveraging Quantum Energy's portfolio of *non-regulated* assets to generate revenue in competitive wholesale energy markets. This could include trading energy from large-scale battery storage projects, participating in demand response markets with C&I customers, or selling renewable energy credits (RECs). It is a purely commercial, profit-driven value stream.

## 3. Cross-Value Stream Dependencies

*   This value stream is the monetization engine for assets developed or managed through non-regulated value streams like **NCV-03 DG & Storage Solution Provision** (e.g., utility-scale storage).
*   It is a specialized, commercially-focused version of **SMV-01 Electric Energy Supply & Trading**, often using the same trading capabilities but with a different objective (profit vs. cost-of-service).
*   It may leverage the same aggregation platform as **SMV-03 DER Aggregation & Optimization**, but applies it to purely commercial ends.
*   It operates under a risk framework defined by **ESV-05 Enterprise Risk Management**, but with a higher risk tolerance than regulated activities.
