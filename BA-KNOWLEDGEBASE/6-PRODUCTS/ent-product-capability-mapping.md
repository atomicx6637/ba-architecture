## Executive Summary

This document provides a crucial mapping between Quantum Energy's products and services and the underlying business capabilities that enable their delivery. This mapping illustrates how "what" we do (capabilities) enables "what" we sell (products) to our customers. It highlights the interplay between regulated and non-regulated capabilities in delivering our diverse portfolio and is fundamental for strategic planning, identifying capability investment needs, and optimizing resource allocation.

## 1. Introduction to Mapping Methodology

This mapping links Quantum Energy's Products and Services (from `ent-product-catalog.md`) to the Level 1 Capabilities (from `ent-capabilities-l1-l2.md`) that enable their delivery. The relationship is indicated as either "Primary" or "Secondary":

*   **Primary (P):** The capability is fundamental and critical for the delivery of the product. Significant reliance on this capability.
*   **Secondary (S):** The capability provides important support, data, or governance to the product delivery, but is not central to its core execution.

The mapping distinguishes capabilities by their primary scope (Regulated, Non-Regulated, or Enterprise) to illustrate the integrated nature of Quantum Energy's business model.
