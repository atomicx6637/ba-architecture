## Executive Summary

This document provides a detailed mapping between Quantum Energy's business capabilities ("what we do") and the organizational units and key roles ("who does it") primarily responsible for their execution. This expanded mapping clarifies accountabilities, highlights interdependencies, and informs resource allocation, ensuring that our organizational structure effectively supports the delivery of both regulated utility services and non-regulated advanced energy solutions.

## 1. Introduction & Methodology

This document extends the conceptual mapping presented in `../../3-CAPABILITIES/ent-capability-to-org-mapping.md` by providing a more granular view and explicitly linking capabilities to specific organizational units and responsible roles within the Quantum Energy structure.

*   **Primary (P):** The organizational unit/role is directly and primarily accountable for the execution of the capability.
*   **Contributing (C):** The organizational unit/role plays a significant supporting or enabling role in the execution of the capability.

## 3. Key Observations & Implications

*   **Clear Ownership for Core Functions:** Regulated operational capabilities (e.g., Energy Generation, Electric/Gas Distribution) are clearly owned by the respective VPs within the Regulated Operations Division under the COO.
*   **Dedicated Non-Regulated Leadership:** `Non-Regulated Product Development` and `Non-Regulated Sales & Marketing` are primarily owned by dedicated VPs within the AES Business Unit under the CDIO, emphasizing focus and agility for growth.
*   **Enterprise-Wide Shared Services:** Core supporting capabilities (e.g., Financial Management, Human Capital Management, IT) are primarily owned by the respective functional leaders within Enterprise Services, serving all business units.
*   **Cross-Functional Collaboration for Integrated Capabilities:** Capabilities like `Customer Engagement & Service` and `System Operations & Grid Control` are enterprise-wide and require significant collaboration across various organizational units (e.g., CCO, CDIO, COO, CIO). This highlights the need for strong operating model interfaces.
*   **Strategic & Oversight Roles:** Executive roles (CEO, CFO, CCO, CDIO, COO, CSO) primarily own strategic, governance, and oversight capabilities.
*   **Regulatory & Legal Integration:** `Legal & Compliance` and `Regulatory & Government Affairs` are embedded across many capabilities, demonstrating their foundational importance to Quantum Energy's operations.

## 4. Next Steps

*   **Detailed RACI Matrices:** For critical L2/L3 capabilities, develop specific RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrices to clarify roles at a more granular, process level.
*   **Workforce Planning:** Use this mapping to identify critical skill sets and resource needs for capability enhancement.
*   **Organizational Design Refinement:** Continuously review and refine the organizational structure to ensure optimal alignment with capability execution and strategic goals.
