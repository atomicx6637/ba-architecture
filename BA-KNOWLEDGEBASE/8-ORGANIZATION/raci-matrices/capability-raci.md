## Executive Summary

This document presents a RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrix for a selection of Quantum Energy's critical business capabilities. It clarifies roles and responsibilities by defining who is Responsible for execution, Accountable for the outcome, Consulted for input, and Informed of progress or decisions. This matrix is essential for effective cross-functional collaboration, particularly where capabilities span regulated and non-regulated business units.

## 1. Introduction to RACI

RACI is a responsibility assignment matrix that maps roles to tasks or deliverables. It ensures that every activity has a clearly defined:
*   **R - Responsible:** The person(s) who perform the work to complete the task. There can be multiple "R"s.
*   **A - Accountable:** The person ultimately answerable for the correct and complete execution of the task. There is only one "A" per task.
*   **C - Consulted:** The person(s) whose opinions are sought, typically subject matter experts. A two-way communication.
*   **I - Informed:** The person(s) who are kept up-to-date on progress or decisions. A one-way communication.

## 3. Key Observations & Implications

*   **Single Point of Accountability:** Each capability (and its L2 decomposition) has a single "A" (Accountable) to ensure clear ownership.
*   **Executive Involvement in Strategic Capabilities:** The CEO is typically "Accountable" or "Consulted" for strategic enterprise-level capabilities (e.g., Enterprise Strategy & Performance Management).
*   **Regulated vs. Non-Regulated Accountability:** The COO is Accountable for core Regulated Operations capabilities (e.g., Electric Distribution, Energy Generation), while the CDIO is Accountable for Non-Regulated Product Development and Sales & Marketing. This reflects the distinct leadership for these two pillars.
*   **Shared Services & Cross-Functional Contribution:** Enterprise-wide capabilities (e.g., Financial Management, IT, Customer Engagement) show broader "Responsible" and "Consulted" involvement from various executive and functional leaders, reflecting their role as shared services.
*   **Digitalization & Analytics:** The CIO and Data Scientist roles are increasingly "Responsible" or "Consulted" across many capabilities, especially those involving digital transformation (e.g., Digital Customer Experience, DERMS Operations).
*   **Regulatory Accounting:** The CFO is Accountable for Regulatory Accounting & Cost Allocation, ensuring adherence to compliance.

## 4. Next Steps

*   **Detailed RACI for L3 Capabilities:** As L3 capabilities are further defined, more granular RACI matrices will be developed, mapping to specific departmental teams and individual roles.
*   **Process-Level RACI:** For specific value stream stages or cross-functional processes, a RACI may be applied to individual tasks to clarify operational responsibilities.
*   **Communication & Training:** The RACI matrix will be communicated to relevant teams and used in training to ensure a common understanding of roles and responsibilities.
