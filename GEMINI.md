# GEMINI.md - Business Architecture Knowledgebase

## Directory Overview

This directory contains the Business Architecture (BA) knowledgebase for a vertically integrated natural gas and electric utility. It serves as a centralized repository for all business architecture artifacts, structured according to the BIZBOK (Business Architecture Body of Knowledge) framework.

The purpose of this knowledgebase is to provide a comprehensive and coherent blueprint of the business, connecting strategy to execution. It defines what the business does (capabilities), how it delivers value (value streams), and the products and services it offers.

This is a non-code project, and the artifacts are maintained as Markdown files.

## Key Files

*   `ba-kb.md`: This is the foundational document for the entire knowledgebase. It defines the structure, organization, governance, and development roadmap for the Business Architecture practice. It outlines the 10 core BIZBOK domains and the "Strategy to Reality" framework used to link strategic goals to operational execution.

*   `ba-capabilities.md`: This file contains the enterprise capability model, which is a hierarchical inventory of "what" the business does. It lists 15 Level 1 and 89 Level 2 capabilities, classified into Strategic, Core, and Supporting groups. This model is the cornerstone of capability-based planning and investment.

*   `ba-products.md`: This document is the customer product catalog, defining over 40 products and services offered to residential, commercial, and industrial customers. It is organized into 7 categories and maps each product to the business capabilities required to deliver it.

*   `ba-value-streams.md`: This file defines the 26 enterprise value streams, which describe the end-to-end flow of value to stakeholders. The value streams are categorized into Customer, Asset & Operations, Supply & Market, Regulatory, Enterprise, and Emergency groups. They illustrate how capabilities are orchestrated to produce outcomes for customers and other stakeholders.

## Usage

The contents of this directory are intended to be used by a wide range of stakeholders, including:

*   **Business Architects and Strategists:** To maintain and evolve the business blueprint, align strategy with execution, and guide transformation initiatives.
*   **Executives and Business Leaders:** To make informed, architecture-based decisions, understand the impact of strategic choices, and guide investment prioritization.
*   **IT and Technology Teams:** To align technology solutions with business needs and ensure that IT investments support business capabilities.
- **Project and Program Managers:** To understand the business context of their initiatives, identify dependencies, and ensure alignment with strategic objectives.
- **Regulators and External Stakeholders:** To provide a clear and transparent view of the utility's operations and how it delivers value to customers.

The artifacts are designed to be living documents, continuously updated to reflect the evolving business. The version control system (Git) should be used to track changes and manage the evolution of the knowledgebase.
