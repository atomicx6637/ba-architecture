## Executive Summary

This document defines the Level One (L1) and Level Two (L2) business capabilities for a vertically integrated natural gas and electric utility. These capabilities represent **what** the business does, independent of **how** it is done or **who** performs it.

The capability model follows BIZBOK principles:
- Capabilities are business-oriented, not organization-specific
- Each capability is unique and mutually exclusive at each level
- Capabilities are stable over time and independent of strategic initiatives
- The model covers the complete value chain from commodity sourcing through customer delivery
- L2 capabilities decompose each L1 into 4-8 sub-capabilities that are collectively exhaustive

This version includes complete L2 decomposition for all 15 Level 1 capabilities, organized into three strategic groupings (Strategic, Core, Supporting) based on their role in value creation and competitive positioning.
