# Business Value Streams
## Vertically Integrated Natural Gas and Electric Utility

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-11-25
**Standard:** BIZBOK Guide to Business Architecture
**Scope:** Enterprise-wide Value Stream Model

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines the business value streams for a vertically integrated natural gas and electric utility. Value streams represent end-to-end flows of value delivery to stakeholders, describing **how** value is created and delivered through a series of stages that transform inputs into valued outputs.

The value stream model follows BIZBOK principles:
- Value streams represent stakeholder-to-stakeholder flows of value
- Each value stream has a clear triggering stakeholder and value proposition
- Value stream stages are enabled by business capabilities
- Value streams are stable patterns independent of organizational structure
- Value streams cross functional and organizational boundaries

This model includes 26 value streams organized into six strategic categories covering customer-facing, operational, regulatory, financial, enterprise, and emergency response domains.
