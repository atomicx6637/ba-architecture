# Enterprise Architecture Service Catalog

## Executive Summary

The Enterprise Architecture (EA) function serves as a strategic partner to the enterprise, providing services that enable informed decision-making, optimize investments, and reduce organizational risk. This catalog defines the services we provide across two primary domains: **Business Architecture** and **Portfolio Strategy Office**.

Our services are designed to **enable and accelerate** business objectives—not to create bottlenecks. We work collaboratively with stakeholders to ensure that strategic initiatives are positioned for success through sound architectural guidance, transparent portfolio management, and alignment of technology investments with business outcomes.
