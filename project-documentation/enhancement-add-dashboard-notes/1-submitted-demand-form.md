# Lightweight Enhancement Demand Form

- **Demand Title:** Add Notes Field to Billing Inquiry Dashboard
- **Requesting Business Unit:** Regulated Billing
- **Business Owner / Team Lead:** Sarah Jenkins
- **Problem Statement:** When handling complex billing inquiries, analysts have no place on the dashboard to jot down notes for context. They have to use separate text files, which is inefficient and prevents other team members from seeing the case history at a glance.
- **Requested Change:** Please add a free-text "Notes" field to the main inquiry tracking dashboard. The field should be able to hold at least 1000 characters.
- **Estimated Effort:** Less than 40 hours.
- **Status:** Approved by Team Lead (Sarah Jenkins) against pre-allocated Enhancement budget.
