# Program Brief (Strategic Initiative)

- **Program Title:** Unified Customer Experience (UCX)
- **Executive Sponsor:** Isabella Rossi (Chief Customer Officer)
- **Link to Strategic Objective:** SO-1: "Deliver a World-Class, Digitally-Enabled Customer Experience"
- **Problem Statement:** Our customer experience is fragmented and inconsistent. Residential and commercial customers interact with us through different portals, our call center agents have to use multiple CRM systems, and we lack a single view of the customer journey. This leads to customer frustration, high service costs, and missed opportunities.
- **Program Vision:** To create a single, unified platform that provides a seamless, consistent, and personalized experience for all customers across all touchpoints. We will create a "360-degree view" of our customers that will enable proactive service and new product offerings.
- **High-Level Scope:** This will be a multi-year program to:
    - Replace the legacy residential and commercial CRM systems with a single, modern platform.
    - Build a new, unified customer-facing web portal and mobile application.
    - Redesign the key customer journeys (e.g., "Start/Stop Service," "View My Bill," "Report an Outage").
    - Integrate the new platform with all necessary backend systems (Billing, CIS, etc.).
- **Initial Cost Estimate (ROM):** >$15 Million over 3 years.
- **Proposed Tier:** Tier 1
