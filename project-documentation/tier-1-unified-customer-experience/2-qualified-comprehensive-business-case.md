# Comprehensive Business Case: Unified Customer Experience (UCX) Program

## 1. Executive Summary
The Unified Customer Experience (UCX) Program is a transformational, three-year, $18 million strategic investment to fundamentally redesign how we interact with our customers. By replacing our fragmented CRM systems and portals with a single, modern platform, we will significantly improve customer satisfaction, reduce operational costs, and unlock new revenue streams. This program directly supports the #1 corporate strategic objective: "Deliver a World-Class, Digitally-Enabled Customer Experience."

## 2. Strategic Alignment
This program is the primary enabler of our corporate strategy. Success will be measured by a step-change in our Net Promoter Score (NPS) and a significant reduction in our Cost to Serve. It is not an optional investment if we are to remain competitive and meet rising customer expectations.
