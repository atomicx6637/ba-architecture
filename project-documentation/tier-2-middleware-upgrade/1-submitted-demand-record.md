# Standard Demand Record

- **Demand ID:** DEM-00174
- **Demand Title:** Core Middleware Platform Upgrade
- **Requesting Business Unit:** Information Technology
- **Business Sponsor:** Maria Rodriguez (VP, IT Platforms)
- **Problem Statement:** The core middleware platform (MessageBus v3.1) connecting our CRM, Billing, and ERP systems is approaching its end-of-life in 12 months. It is running on unsupported hardware, lacks modern security features (e.g., OAuth 2.0), and is becoming a performance bottleneck during peak hours. Failure of this platform would result in major business disruption.
- **Business Goal:** Mitigate the risk of platform failure and improve system performance and security by upgrading to the vendor-supported MessageBus v4.5. This is a foundational investment to ensure business continuity and future scalability.
- **High-Level Scope:**
    - Procure new hardware and software licenses for MessageBus v4.5.
    - Plan and execute the migration of all existing integrations from the v3.1 to the v4.5 platform.
    - Conduct extensive performance and regression testing with all connected systems.
    - Decommission the old v3.1 platform.
- **Initial Cost Estimate:** $1,200,000
- **Proposed Tier:** Tier 2 (due to high impact and cross-functional dependency)
