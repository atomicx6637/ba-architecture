# Standard Demand Record

- **Demand ID:** DEM-00173
- **Demand Title:** Implement Fleet Vehicle GPS Tracking & Telematics System
- **Requesting Business Unit:** Fleet Management
- **Business Sponsor:** David Chen
- **Problem Statement:** The current fleet of 250 vehicles has no centralized tracking system. This leads to inefficient routing, inability to monitor driver behavior for safety, and reliance on manual logs for maintenance scheduling. We are likely overspending on fuel and maintenance due to this lack of visibility.
- **Business Goal:** Implement a telematics solution to provide real-time GPS tracking, vehicle health monitoring, and driver safety analytics. This will reduce fuel costs, improve maintenance cycles, and increase driver safety.
- **High-Level Scope:**
    - Procure and install GPS hardware in 250 fleet vehicles.
    - Implement a cloud-based software platform for monitoring and reporting.
    - Integrate the system with our existing maintenance-logging application.
    - Train 5 fleet managers and all drivers on the new system.
- **Initial Cost Estimate:** $225,000
- **Proposed Tier:** Tier 3
