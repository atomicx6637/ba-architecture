# Business Case: Fleet Telematics System

## 1. Executive Summary
This document proposes an investment of $225,000 to implement a GPS tracking and telematics system for the company's fleet of 250 vehicles. This initiative will provide significant returns through fuel savings, reduced maintenance costs, and improved safety, with an expected Return on Investment (ROI) within 24 months.

## 2. Problem Statement
Fleet Management lacks real-time visibility into vehicle location, usage, and condition. This results in:
- **High Fuel Costs:** Inefficient routing and excessive idling.
- **Reactive Maintenance:** We cannot predict vehicle issues, leading to more costly repairs and downtime.
- **Safety & Liability Risks:** No data to monitor or coach driver behavior (speeding, harsh braking).

## 3. Proposed Solution
Implement a vendor-provided telematics solution that includes:
- Real-time GPS tracking for route optimization.
- Vehicle diagnostic data (engine hours, fault codes) pushed to a central dashboard.
- Driver behavior monitoring and scorecards.

## 4. Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Estimated Costs:
- **Hardware (250 units @ $300/unit):** $75,000
- **Software Subscription (Year 1):** $50,000
- **Installation & Implementation Services:** $100,000
- **Total:** **$225,000**

### Estimated Annual Benefits:
- **Fuel Savings (10% reduction):** $90,000
- **Reduced Maintenance Costs (15% reduction):** $30,000
- **Insurance Premium Reduction (projected):** $15,000
- **Total Annual Benefit:** **$135,000**

## 5. Return on Investment (ROI)
- **Payback Period:** Approx. 20 months.
- **Recommendation:** This project offers clear financial benefits and aligns with the corporate goal of "Operational Excellence." We recommend it be approved for funding.
