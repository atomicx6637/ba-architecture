# Standard Demand Record (for a POC)

- **Demand ID:** DEM-00176
- **Demand Title:** Proof of Concept (POC): Next-Generation Network Management Software
- **Requesting Business Unit:** Network Operations
- **Business Sponsor:** Charles Webb (Director, Network Operations)
- **Problem Statement:** Our current network monitoring tools are reactive. We only learn about hardware failures or misconfigurations after they have caused an impact. We lack the ability to perform predictive or proactive analysis.
- **Business Goal (Hypothesis to be Tested):** This POC aims to validate whether a modern, AI-enabled software platform ("NetPredict v2.0") can provide predictive failure analysis and automated root-cause analysis for our specific network environment. The goal is to gather data to make an informed decision on whether to pursue a full-scale implementation.
- **High-Level Scope:**
    - Procure temporary licenses and vendor support for NetPredict v2.0.
    - Install the software in a sandboxed, non-production lab environment.
    - Mirror live network traffic from one data center to the lab.
    - Conduct a 60-day test against a representative sample of our network hardware.
    - Evaluate the results against pre-defined success criteria.
- **Initial Cost Estimate:** $75,000 (for licenses and vendor professional services)
- **Proposed Tier:** Tier 3 (to ensure visibility and proper governance for this experiment)
