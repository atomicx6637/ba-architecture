# POC Findings & Recommendation

## 1. POC Summary
- **POC Title:** Next-Generation Network Management Software (NetPredict v2.0)
- **Date:** January 15, 2026
- **Outcome:** The 60-day POC has been completed. The results were positive and have provided valuable data to justify a full-scale implementation.

## 2. Results vs. Success Criteria

| Criteria | Result | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Setup** | Installation completed in 8 days. | **PASS** |
| **2. Prediction** | Correctly predicted 3 of 3 simulated hardware failures. | **PASS** |
| **3. Root Cause**| Correctly identified the root cause in 5 of 5 outage scenarios. The average time to identification was 3 minutes. | **PASS** |
| **4. Usability** | The average usability score from the 5 engineers on the POC team was 4.5 / 5. | **PASS** |

## 3. Key Learnings
- The predictive analytics engine was even more effective than hypothesized.
- The vendor's professional services were critical for a successful installation; self-installation would have been difficult.
- The software requires significant CPU/memory resources, which will need to be factored into the budget for a full rollout.
- Integration with our existing ticketing system (ServiceNow) is possible via a pre-built connector, which would be a major goal of a full implementation.

## 4. Recommendation
The POC was highly successful and validated the vendor's claims. We have high confidence that a full implementation will significantly improve our network reliability and reduce our mean-time-to-repair (MTTR).

**Recommendation: Proceed with a Full Implementation Project.**

## 5. Next Steps
- A new **Tier 2 Demand** will be submitted for the full, enterprise-wide implementation of NetPredict v2.0.
- The budget for the new demand will be estimated at **$950,000**, based on the learnings from this POC.
- This findings document will be attached to the new demand record to serve as the foundation for its business case.
