# Discussion Script: Unifying All Work as Demand for the Architecture Review Board (ARB)

**Objective:** To gain the ARB's partnership and championship in adopting the new Portfolio Demand Management process for *all* initiatives, including Capital Projects, O&M Enhancements, and Proofs of Concept (POCs).

### 1. Introduction: Setting the Stage

"Good morning, everyone. Thank you for the time today. We want to talk about the new demand management process and, specifically, how the ARB's partnership can be a critical catalyst for its success.

Our collective goal is to ensure the technology investments we make are strategic, sound, and delivered efficiently. Today, we're often forced into a reactive mode, reviewing projects that are already in-flight or discovering redundant efforts too late in the game.

The vision, as laid out in the **Strategic Portfolio and Change Management Plan**, is to move toward a model of **full transparency** for all work, enabling us to be more proactive and strategic advisors to the business."

### 2. The Shared Problems We Face Today

"We've all felt the pain of the current state. Does this sound familiar?

*   **Surprise Projects:** A significant project appears on your review agenda with little to no prior warning, forcing a rushed architectural review.
*   **Inconsistent Entry Points:** Great ideas and critical needs get stuck in email inboxes or side conversations, with no clear or consistent path to get them evaluated.
*   **Shadow IT & POCs:** We know innovation is happening, but we have no formal visibility into Proofs of Concept. We can't learn from them, and successful ones have no clear path to becoming enterprise solutions.
*   **Technical Debt by a Thousand Cuts:** We review large capital projects, but dozens of small 'enhancements' fly under the radar. Each one might be fine on its own, but collectively they can create significant architectural drift and technical debt.
*   **Resource Strain:** We lack a single view of the *total* demand on our architecture and delivery teams, making it nearly impossible to do effective capacity planning."

### 3. The Solution: "Right-Sized" Governance, Not More Bureaucracy

"The new Demand Management framework is designed to solve these problems without creating unnecessary overhead. It's not a 'one-size-fits-all' model. The core principle is **right-sized governance based on risk and investment level**.

As you know, the model categorizes all incoming work into tiers:

| Tier | Example | Governance Approach | Why it Helps ARB |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Break-Fix** | Production outage | **Autonomy.** Managed via standard ticketing. | No distraction. ARB stays focused on strategic work. |
| **Enhancement** | Add a field to a UI | **Lightweight.** Simple form, approved by the team lead. | **Visibility without overhead.** We see where O&M effort is going, allowing us to spot trends (e.g., a system needing many enhancements may be a candidate for replacement). |
| **Tier 3 (Small Project)** | Implement a new departmental tool | **Standard.** Business case required, reviewed by the Subcommittee. | **Early insight.** ARB gets visibility into smaller projects that could have architectural impact or create new data silos. |
| **Tier 2 (Medium Project)** | Upgrade a shared platform | **Formal.** Includes a mandatory architectural review. | **Proactive engagement.** This is the sweet spot for ARB to guide technical decisions *before* they are set in stone. |
| **Tier 1 (Strategic Program)** | Launch a new digital platform | **Strategic.** Deep involvement from EA and leadership from the start. | **Strategic alignment.** ARB is positioned as a key strategic partner from day one. |

This tiered approach gives us a mechanism to handle every type of work appropriately."

### 4. How We Handle All Project Types

"This model only works if we get *all* work into the funnel. Here’s how we see the different types of projects fitting in:

#### **Capital Projects (Tiers 1-3)**
This is the most natural fit and where we'll see immediate benefits. By capturing these as demands, the ARB gets the early visibility needed to prevent architectural issues and ensure alignment with enterprise standards.

#### **O&M and Enhancements (Enhancement Tier)**
The goal here is **visibility, not bureaucracy**. We are asking teams to log these small, discretionary improvements via a simple, one-page form.
*   **Benefit for Teams:** They get autonomy to manage their own backlog and budget.
*   **Benefit for ARB:** You get a powerful new lens. By analyzing enhancement data, you can spot systemic issues. A high volume of requests against one application might signal underlying technical debt or a capability gap that warrants a larger, strategic investment. It turns reactive 'whack-a-mole' into proactive problem-solving.

#### **Proofs of Concept (POCs) (Tier 3)**
This is one of the most critical areas for the ARB. When POCs run in the shadows, we lose.
*   If it **fails**, nobody learns the lesson, and another team may try the same thing next year.
*   If it **succeeds**, it often gets stuck in 'POC purgatory' or gets pushed into production without proper architectural oversight, creating the next legacy system.

By bringing POCs into the demand process as **Tier 3 projects**, we achieve several goals:
1.  **Visibility:** The ARB knows what experiments are happening and can offer guidance.
2.  **Learning:** The results and findings are captured and shared.
3.  **A Path Forward:** Successful POCs have a documented business case and a clear path to be evaluated for further funding as a Tier 2 or Tier 1 project.

### 5. Our Ask: Be the Change With Us

"This transformation isn't just a process change; it's a cultural one. To make it stick, we need influential leaders like you to be champions. Here is what we are asking of the ARB:

1.  **Champion the Vision:** Publicly endorse the goal of getting all work into a single, transparent pipeline. Help us communicate that this is about making better decisions, not adding red tape.
2.  **Model the Behavior:** When initiatives are discussed in this forum, ask the question: **"Is there a demand record for this?"** Making this a standard part of the ARB conversation will be the single most effective way to reinforce the new process.
3.  **Partner with Us:** As you review projects, if you see something that should have been in the system but wasn't, use it as a coaching opportunity. Help us guide teams toward the front door.
4.  **Provide Feedback:** Help us refine the process. You have a unique, cross-enterprise view and will see the friction points before anyone else. Work with us to make this system as efficient as possible.

With your partnership, we can move from being architectural firefighters to architectural strategists."
